    "## Introduction to Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order of operation. This order can either be Last In First Out (LIFO) or First In Last Out (FILO).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a pile of books that you plan to read. You keep adding books to the top of the pile. When you're ready to start reading, you take a book from the top of the pile. The last book you added to the pile is the first one you read. That's LIFO - the principle that stack data structures operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes stacks so unique is their simplicity and elegance. Despite being straightforward, they can be incredibly powerful when used in the right way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world Examples of Stacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into technicalities, let's familiarize ourselves with stacks in our daily lives. Stacks are everywhere around us, even if we might not notice them. Here are some examples to help you relate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stack of Books:** This is perhaps the simplest example. A pile of books is a stack. The book on the top was the last one added and will be the first one removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stack of Plates:** Picture a stack of plates at a buffet. The first plate you'll take is the one on top, which was the last one put on the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Browser History:** Every time you visit a new webpage, it's added to the top of your history stack. When you hit the back button, you're \"popping\" pages off the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undo Function in Software Applications:** The undo function in software applications uses a stack to remember actions. The most recent action is on top and will be the first one undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these examples, it's clear that stacks are not just a theoretical concept, but a practical one that we use unconsciously in our daily lives. With this understanding, let's dive deeper into the operations that define stacks in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The LIFO Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, stacks in data structures operate on the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last item added to the stack is the first one that gets taken out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIFO principle is the heart of stack data structures. It governs how we add and remove elements, making stack operations predictable and consistent. With that, let's explore the primary operations that you can perform on a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four key operations that you can perform on a stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Push:** This is how we add an element to the stack. The element is always added to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pop:** This is the removal of an element from the stack. The element removed is always from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Peek or Top:** This operation allows us to see the element on the top of the stack without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **IsEmpty:** This operation checks if the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see these stack operations in detail in the next section.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Applications of Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have gained a solid understanding of stack operations and their implementation, it's time to bring it all together by exploring the real-world applications of stacks. This fascinating data structure has a multitude of uses across many different areas in computer science, from memory management and compiler design to problem-solving in data analysis. Let's dive in!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary uses of stacks is in memory management. Ever wondered how your computer remembers which functions it's running and in which order? The answer is stacks! When a function is called in a program, the system 'pushes' it onto a call stack. When the function finishes running, it's 'popped' off the stack. This mechanism allows for nested function calls, where one function can call another.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also how recursion works in programming. When a function calls itself, each recursive call is added to the stack with its own set of variables. Once the base case is met, the functions start resolving and are popped off the stack one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expression Evaluation and Syntax Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "Another critical application of stacks is in evaluating mathematical expressions and parsing syntax in code compilers. Consider an arithmetic expression like 2 + 3 * 4. Before performing the operations, we need to check the precedence of the operators to get the correct result. Here, stacks come in handy to apply the BODMAS rule (Bracket, Order, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing operators in a stack can help manage their execution order. Similar logic applies when compilers parse code syntax. They use stacks to check if all opening brackets have matching closing ones, which helps validate the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Undo Mechanism in Software Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wondered how the 'undo' feature works in software applications like text editors, image editors, or even web browsers? Once again, stacks save the day. Each action you perform is pushed onto a stack. When you hit 'undo', the most recent action is popped from the stack and reversed. It's a practical and elegant solution to a problem we encounter every day!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtracking Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking algorithms solve problems by trying out solutions and undoing them if they don't lead to a solution. This is common in puzzles like Sudoku, the Eight Queens problem, and the Knight's Tour problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such scenarios, stacks are used to store the intermediate stages of the problem. When an attempted solution doesn't work out, the algorithm can 'pop' back to a previous state and try a different path. It's like having a 'save game' feature when you're tackling a challenging puzzle!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are also used in graph algorithms, specifically Depth-First Search (DFS). DFS explores a graph by visiting a node and recursively investigating all its unvisited neighbors. The algorithm uses a stack to remember which nodes to visit next when it finishes exploring a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "By 'pushing' unvisited nodes onto the stack and 'popping' them once visited, DFS systematically explores every node in the graph. This method is particularly useful in network routing, AI behavior in games, and detecting cycles in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Page History in Browsers\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an everyday example of stacks in action is web page history in a browser. When you click a link, your current page is 'pushed' onto a stack, and you're taken to a new page. If you hit the 'back' button, your browser 'pops' the topmost page off the stack, taking you back to where you were. It's a simple, intuitive way to navigate the vast expanse of the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these examples, you can see just how versatile and vital stacks are in computer science and everyday applications.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `s` containing `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, and `}` characters. Determine if a given string of parentheses is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "```\n",
    "String s = \"{[()]}\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expected Output: \n",
    "```\n",
    "true\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The parentheses in this string are perfectly balanced. Every opening parenthesis `{`, `[`, `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `}`, `]`, `)` in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "```\n",
    "String s = \"{[}]\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expected Output: \n",
    "```\n",
    "false\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The brackets are not balanced in this string. Although it contains the same number of opening and closing brackets for each type, they are not correctly ordered. The `]` closes `[` before `{` can be closed by `}`, and similarly, `}` closes `{` before `[` can be closed by `]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \n",
    "```\n",
    "String s = \"(]\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expected Output: \n",

    "false\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation: The parentheses in this string are not balanced. Here, `)` does not have a matching opening parenthesis `(`, and similarly, `]` does not have a matching opening bracket `[`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= `s.length` <= 104\n",
    "- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use a stack data structure. As we traverse the string, each time we encounter an opening parenthesis `'('`, `'{'`, or `'['`, we push it onto the stack. When we find a closing parenthesis `')'`, `'}'`, or `']'`, we check if it matches the type of the opening parenthesis at the top of the stack. If it matches, we pop the top element from the stack; if not, or if the stack is empty when we find a closing parenthesis, the string is not balanced, and we return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means all parentheses were properly closed and nested, so we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty Stack.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the string of parentheses.\n",
    "    - If the current character is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the Stack.\n",
    "    - If the current character is a closing parenthesis, check the top of the Stack.\n",
    "        - If the Stack is empty, then the string is not balanced (there is a closing parenthesis without a matching opening parenthesis), so return `false`.\n",
    "        - If the top of the Stack is the matching opening parenthesis, pop it off the Stack.\n",
    "        - If the top of the Stack is not the matching opening parenthesis, then the string is not balanced, so return `false`.\n",
    "3. After checking all parentheses, if the Stack is empty, then the string is balanced, so return `true`. If the Stack is not empty, then there are unmatched opening parentheses, so the string is not balanced, return `false`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Iteration 4: Character = ')'**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack before operation: `['{', '[', '(']`\n",
    "`')'` is a closing bracket. The top of the stack is `'('`, which is the corresponding opening bracket for `')'`. So, pop `'('` from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration 5: Character = ']'**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack before operation: `['{', '[']`\n",

    "\n",
    "**Final Check:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After processing all characters, check the stack.\n",
    "The stack is empty, indicating that all opening brackets were properly matched and closed.\n",

    "We can use a stack to efficiently create the binary representation of a given decimal number. Our algorithm will take advantage of the 'Last In, First Out' property of stacks to reverse the order of the binary digits, since the binary representation is constructed from least significant bit to most significant bit, but needs to be displayed in the opposite order. The procedure involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2, pushing the remainder onto the stack, which corresponds to the binary digit. When the number is reduced to 0, the algorithm pops elements off the stack and appends to the result string until the stack is empty, thereby reversing the order of digits. The result is the binary equivalent of the input decimal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by creating an empty stack. A stack is chosen because of its \"Last In, First Out\" property which is perfect for this type of problem where we need to reverse the order of the operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter into a loop where the given number is repeatedly divided by 2. This is because the binary number system is base 2, and each bit represents a power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inside the loop, the remainder when the number is divided by 2 (which is either 0 or 1) is pushed onto the stack. This remainder is essentially the bit in the binary representation of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Update the number by integer division by 2. This step essentially \"shifts\" the number one bit to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the number becomes zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. At this point, the stack contains the binary representation of the number, but in reverse order. This is because the first bit we calculated (the least significant bit, or the \"rightmost\" bit) is on the top of the stack, while the last bit we calculated (the most significant bit, or the \"leftmost\" bit) is on the bottom of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Reverse this order by popping the stack until it's empty and appending each popped bit to the result. Since a stack follows \"Last In, First Out\" rule, this will correctly reverse the order of the bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally, return the result, which is the binary representation of the original number."

    "A simple algorithm is to run two loops: the outer loop picks all elements one by one, and the inner loop looks for the first greater element for the element picked by the outer loop. However, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a more optimized approach using Stack data structure. The algorithm will leverage the nature of the stack data structure, where the most recently added (pushed) elements are the first ones to be removed (popped). Starting from the end of the array, the algorithm always maintains elements in the stack that are larger than the current element. This way, it ensures that it has a candidate for the \"next larger element\". If there is no larger element, it assigns -1 to that position. It handles each element of the array only once, making it an efficient solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty stack `s` and an output array `res` of size equal to the input array, with all elements initialized to -1. `res` will store the result, i.e., the next larger element for each position in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start a loop that goes from the last index of the array to the first (0 index).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In each iteration, while there are elements in the stack and the top element of the stack is less than or equal to the current element in the array, remove elements from the stack. This step ensures that we retain only the elements in the stack that are larger than the current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After the popping process, if there is still an element left in the stack, it is the next larger element for the current array element. So, assign the top element of the stack to the corresponding position in the `res` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now, push the current array element into the stack. This action considers the current element as a possible \"next larger element\" for the upcoming elements in the remaining iterations.\n",

    "Given an absolute file path in a Unix-style file system, simplify it by converting \"..\" to the previous directory and removing any \".\" or multiple slashes. The resulting string should represent the shortest absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:** \"/a//b////c/d//././/..\"\n",
    "   **Output:** \"/a/b/c\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Input:** \"/../\"\n",
    "   **Output:** \"/\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Input:** \"/home//foo/\"\n",
    "   **Output:** \"/home/foo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= path.length <= 3000\n",
    "- path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.\n",
    "- path is a valid absolute Unix path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the path, we'll use a stack to track the directories we're currently in. We'll split the input path into components by the \"/\" character, then process each component one by one. If a component is \"..\", we go to the previous directory by popping the top of the stack. If a component is \".\" or an empty string, we do nothing. Otherwise, we push the component into the stack as a new directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Algorithm steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the input path by the \"/\" character into an array of components.\n",
    "2. Initialize an empty stack.\n",
    "3. For each component in the array:\n",
    "   - If the component is \"..\", pop the top of the stack (if it's not already empty).\n",
    "   - Else if the component is \".\" or an empty string, do nothing.\n",
    "   - Else, push the component into the stack as a new directory.\n",
    "4. Finally, combine the components in the stack into a string, separated by the \"/\" character. Add a \"/\" at the start to denote an absolute path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the code using the input \"/a//b////c/d//././/..\" step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Stack:** A Stack<String> is created to store components of the simplified path.\n",
    "2. **Split the Path:** The input path \"/a//b////c/d//././/..\" is split using \"/\" as the delimiter. The resulting parts are: [\"\", \"a\", \"\", \"b\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"c\", \"d\", \"\", \".\", \"\", \".\", \"\", \"\", \"..\"]. Empty strings and dots (\".\") represent the current directory and will be ignored in further processing.\n",
    "3. **Process Each Part:**\n",
    "   - First Part (\"\"): It's empty, so it's ignored.\n",
    "   - Second Part (\"a\"): It's a directory name and is pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "   - Third Part (\"\"): Ignored.\n",
    "   - Fourth Part (\"b\"): Another directory name, pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "   - Next Several Parts (\"\", \"\", \"\"): All empty, so ignored.\n",
    "   - Part \"c\": A directory name, pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "   - Part \"d\": Another directory name, pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "   - Part \".\": Represents the current directory, ignored.\n",
    "   - Part \".\" (again): Again, represents the current directory, ignored.\n",
    "   - Last Part (\"..\"): Represents moving up one directory. It pops \"d\" from the stack.\n",
    "   - After processing, the stack contains: [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"].\n",
    "4. **Reconstruct Simplified Path:**\n",
    "   - A StringBuilder is used to construct the final simplified path.\n",
    "   - The stack is processed in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order. Each component is popped and appended to the start of the result string, preceded by \"/\".\n",
    "   - After processing the stack, the StringBuilder contains \"/a/b/c\".\n",
    "5. **Return the Result:**\n",
    "   - The StringBuilder is converted to a string and returned.\n",
    "   - For the given input, the output is \"/a/b/c\"."

    "Given a string `s`, convert it into a valid string. A string is considered valid if it does not have any two adjacent duplicate characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "**Input:** `\"abbaca\"`  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** `\"ca\"`  \n",
    "**Description:** We remove `'b'` from `\"abbaca\"` to get `\"aaca\"`, then remove `'a'` from `\"aaca\"` to get `\"ca\"`\n",

    "#### Example 2\n",
    "**Input:** `\"azxxzy\"`  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** `\"ay\"`  \n",

    "**Description:** We remove `'b'` from `\"abba\"` to get `\"aa\"`, then remove `'a'` from `\"aa\"` to get an empty string\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- 1 <= `str.length` <= 10^5\n",
    "- `str` consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can utilize a stack data structure. The stack helps us to keep track of the characters in the string as we iterate through it. For each character in the string, we compare it with the top element of the stack. If they match, it indicates a pair of adjacent duplicates, and we remove the top element from the stack. Otherwise, we add the current character to the stack. This approach effectively removes all adjacent duplicate pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have processed all characters, the remaining elements in the stack represent the string with all adjacent duplicates removed. The final step involves converting the stack contents back into a string in the original order, which can be achieved by reversing the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty stack.\n",
    "2. Iterate over each character in the input string.\n",
    "   - For each character, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is equal to the current character.\n",
    "     - If it is, pop the top element from the stack.\n",
    "     - If it's not, push the current character into the stack.\n",
    "3. After the iteration, convert the stack into a string. The order of the characters in the stack is the reverse of the final valid string, so reverse the stack's string before returning.\n",
    "4. Return the final valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "Let's walk through the example `\"abbaca\"` step by step using the stack-based algorithm:\n",
    "1. **Initialize an Empty Stack:** Start with an empty stack to keep track of the characters.\n",
    "2. **Process First Character ('a'):**\n",
    "   - Current Character: `'a'`\n",
    "   - Since the stack is empty, push `'a'` onto the stack.\n",
    "   - Stack after operation: `['a']`\n",
    "3. **Process Second Character ('b'):**\n",
    "   - Current Character: `'b'`\n",
    "   - `'b'` is not the same as the top element of the stack (`'a'`), so push `'b'`.\n",
    "   - Stack after operation: `['a', 'b']`\n",
    "4. **Process Third Character ('b'):**\n",
    "   - Current Character: `'b'`\n",
    "   - `'b'` matches the top element of the stack, so pop the top element (`'b'`).\n",
    "   - Stack after operation: `['a']`\n",
    "5. **Process Fourth Character ('a'):**\n",
    "   - Current Character: `'a'`\n",
    "   - `'a'` matches the top element of the stack, so pop the top element (`'a'`).\n",
    "   - Stack after operation: `[]`\n",
    "6. **Process Fifth Character ('c'):**\n",
    "   - Current Character: `'c'`\n",
    "   - Stack is empty, so push `'c'`.\n",
    "   - Stack after operation: `['c']`\n",
    "7. **Process Sixth Character ('a'):**\n",
    "   - Current Character: `'a'`\n",
    "   - `'a'` is not the same as the top element of the stack (`'c'`), so push `'a'`.\n",
    "   - Stack after operation: `['c', 'a']`\n",
    "8. **Final Step - Convert Stack to String:**\n",
    "   - The final stack is `['c', 'a']`.\n",
    "   - Convert this stack to a string by concatenating the elements in order.\n",
    "   - The resulting string is `\"ca\"`.\n",
    "   - So, the output for the input string `\"abbaca\"` is `\"ca\"`, as all adjacent duplicates have been successfully removed.\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string of English lowercase and uppercase letters, make the string \"good\" by removing two adjacent characters that are the same but in different cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue to do this until there are no more adjacent characters of the same letter but in different cases. An empty string is also considered \"good\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `\"AaBbCcDdEeff\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `\"ff\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: In the first step, `\"AaBbCcDdEeff\"` becomes `\"BbcCDdEeff\"` because `'A'` and `'a'` are the same letter, but one is uppercase and the other is lowercase. Then we remove `\"Bb\"`, and then `\"cC\"`, `\"dD\"`, and `\"Ee\"`. In the end, we are left with `\"ff\"` which we can't remove - although both characters are the same but with the same case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `\"abBA\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `\"\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: In the first step, `\"abBA\"` becomes `\"aA\"` because `'b'` and `'B'` are the same letter, but one is uppercase and the other is lowercase. Then `\"aA\"` becomes `\"\"` for the same reason. The final string is empty, which is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `\"s\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: `\"s\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The string `\"s\"` is already good because it only contains one character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(1 \\leq \\text{length of } s \\leq 100\\)\n",
    "- \\(s\\) contains only lower and upper case English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, a stack-based approach can be employed. The algorithm iterates through each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the stack is not empty and if the top element of the stack is the opposite case version of the current character (one uppercase and one lowercase of the same letter). If they are, both characters are removed; otherwise, the current character is added to the stack. This process is repeated until the end of the string. The remaining elements in the stack represent the transformed \"great\" string. The stack ensures that we efficiently manage the removal of adjacent characters and helps to achieve the final string in an optimized way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Step-by-Step Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty stack.\n",
    "2. For each character in the string from left to right:\n",
    "   - If the stack is not empty and the current character and the top of the stack are the same letter but in different cases, pop the stack.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, push the current character into the stack.\n",
    "3. The characters in the stack form the final string. Note that the order of the characters in the stack is the same as their order in the final string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the input `\"AaBbCcDdEeff\"` and observe how the above algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize an Empty Stack:** Begin with an empty stack.\n",
    "2. **Process Each Character:** Go through each character of the string one by one:\n",
    "   - Character `'A'`: Stack is empty, so push `'A'` onto the stack. Stack: `['A']`.\n",
    "   - Character `'a'`: Top of the stack is `'A'`, which is the uppercase version of `'a'`. Pop `'A'` from the stack. Stack becomes empty.\n",
    "   - Character `'B'`: Stack is empty, so push `'B'` onto the stack. Stack: `['B']`.\n",
    "   - Character `'b'`: Top of the stack is `'B'`, which is the uppercase version of `'b'`. Pop `'B'` from the stack. Stack becomes empty.\n",
    "   - Character `'C'`: Stack is empty, so push `'C'` onto the stack. Stack: `['C']`.\n",
    "   - Character `'c'`: Top of the stack is `'C'`, which is the uppercase version of `'c'`. Pop `'C'` from the stack. Stack becomes empty.\n",
    "   - Character `'D'`: Stack is empty, so push `'D'` onto the stack. Stack: `['D']`.\n",
    "   - Character `'d'`: Top of the stack is `'D'`, which is the uppercase version of `'d'`. Pop `'D'` from the stack. Stack becomes empty.\n",
    "   - Character `'E'`: Stack is empty, so push `'E'` onto the stack. Stack: `['E']`.\n",
    "   - Character `'e'`: Top of the stack is `'E'`, which is the uppercase version of `'e'`. Pop `'E'` from the stack. Stack becomes empty.\n",
    "   - Character `'f'`: Stack is empty, so push `'f'` onto the stack. Stack: `['f']`.\n",
    "   - Character `'f'`: Top of the stack is `'f'`, but it's not the opposite case version of the current `'f'`. Push `'f'` onto the stack. Stack: `['f', 'f']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resulting String\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the iteration, the stack contains `['f', 'f']`. The contents of the stack are then converted back to a string, which gives `\"ff\"` as the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the transformed \"great\" string for the input `\"AaBbCcDdEeff\"` is `\"ff\"`.\n",
