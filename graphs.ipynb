    "# Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are fundamental structures in computer science used to represent networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, and web pages linking to each other. They consist of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges (or links). The two primary types of graph traversal techniques are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). Let's explore each concept in detail with markdown diagrams and sample code.\n",

    "Graphs can be represented in various ways:\n",
    "1. **Adjacency List**: Each node stores a list of adjacent nodes.\n",
    "2. **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where the cell at row `i` and column `j` is `1` (or the weight of the edge) if there is an edge from node `i` to node `j`.\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The task at hand is to determine if there's a path from a starting node to an ending node in a given undirected graph. Our approach uses Depth First Search (DFS) to explore the graph recursively. Starting at the initial node, we'll dive as deep as possible into its neighboring nodes. If we reach the target node at any point during the traversal, we know a path exists. If we exhaust all possible routes and haven't found the target, then no path exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph Representation:** We'll begin by converting the provided edge list into an adjacency list to represent our graph. The adjacency list is essentially an array (or list) of lists, where each index corresponds to a node, and its content is a list of neighbors for that node. Since our graph is undirected, if there's an edge between nodes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), both \\(A\\) will be in \\(B\\)'s list and \\(B\\) in \\(A\\)'s list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Depth First Search (DFS):** With our graph ready, we then use a recursive DFS function to traverse the graph. This function starts at the given node, and if it's the target node, we return true. Otherwise, we mark this node as visited and call the DFS function on all its unvisited neighbors. This dives deeper into the graph. If any of these recursive calls return true (meaning they found the target), our current DFS call also returns true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Cycles:** To avoid getting stuck in a loop, especially in cyclic graphs, we keep track of which nodes we've visited. Before exploring a node, we'll check if it's been visited; if it has, we'll skip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** If our DFS exploration reaches the target node, we return true, signifying that a path exists. Otherwise, after checking all paths from the starting node and not finding the target, we'll conclude and return false.\n",

    "### Explanation of Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Initialization**:\n",
    "   - We use a `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to create an adjacency list representation of the graph. This ensures that each node points to a list of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating the Adjacency List**:\n",
    "   - For each edge in the `edges` list, we add the connection in both directions (since the graph is undirected). For example, if there is an edge between node `u` and node `v`, we add `v` to the list of neighbors of `u` and `u` to the list of neighbors of `v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visited Set**:\n",
    "   - We use a set named `visited` to keep track of nodes that have already been visited during the DFS to avoid cycles and redundant checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DFS Function**:\n",
    "   - The `dfs` function takes the current node as input.\n",
    "   - If the current node is the `endNode`, we have found a path and return `True`.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, we mark the current node as visited.\n",
    "   - We then iterate through each neighbor of the current node. If a neighbor has not been visited, we recursively call the `dfs` function on that neighbor.\n",
    "   - If any of these recursive calls return `True`, we return `True`.\n",
    "   - If none of the recursive calls find a path to the `endNode`, we return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Starting the DFS**:\n",
    "   - We start the DFS from the `startNode`.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Code\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - `visited = [False] * len(isConnected)`: This list keeps track of whether each city has been visited.\n",
    "   - `province_count = 0`: This variable counts the number of provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**\n",
    "   - The `dfs` function takes a `city` as an argument. It marks the current city as visited and recursively visits all directly connected cities that have not been visited yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Main Loop:**\n",
    "   - The main loop iterates through each city. If a city has not been visited, it starts a new province, and `dfs` is called to visit all cities in that province. After the `dfs` call, `province_count` is incremented.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Returning the Result:**\n",
    "   - After all cities have been processed, `province_count` contains the total number of provinces and is returned as the result."

    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes 0 and 2 are the only nodes that don't have incoming edges. Hence, you need to start from these nodes to reach node 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "n = 5\n",

    "**Justification:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Node 1 can be reached from both nodes 0 and 2, but to cover all nodes, you also need to start from node 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5\\)\n",
    "- \\(1 \\leq edges.length \\leq min(10^5, n \\times (n - 1) / 2)\\)\n",
    "- `edges[i].length == 2`\n",
    "- \\(0 \\leq from_i, to_i < n\\)\n",
    "- All pairs (from_i, to_i) are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of vertices needed to reach all nodes in a directed graph, we focus on the concept of \"in-degree\" which represents the number of incoming edges to a node. In a directed graph, if a node doesn't have any incoming edges (in-degree of 0), then it means that the node cannot be reached from any other node. Hence, such nodes are mandatory starting points to ensure that every node in the graph can be reached. Our algorithm thus identifies all nodes with an in-degree of 0 as they are potential starting points to traverse the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation:** Begin by representing the graph using an adjacency list or a similar data structure.\n",
    "2. **In-Degree Calculation:** Compute the in-degree for all the nodes. The in-degree of a node is the number of edges coming into it. This can be done by initializing an array to keep track of in-degrees for each node and iterating over the edges to update the in-degree counts.\n",
    "3. **Result Gathering:** Iterate over the computed in-degrees. Nodes with an in-degree of 0 don't have any incoming edges and thus are part of our result set as they serve as starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the solution using the example `n = 6` and `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,5],[3,4],[4,2]]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Start with an in-degree array initialized to zeros for all nodes: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Iterate over the edges. For each edge (source, destination), increment the in-degree of the destination node by 1. After processing all edges, the in-degree array becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Finally, by examining the in-degree array, nodes 0 and 3 are identified as having an in-degree of 0. This means they don't receive any incoming edges, and thus, they become our result set: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from these nodes, we can reach all other nodes in the graph."
