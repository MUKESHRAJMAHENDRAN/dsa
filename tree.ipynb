    "## 1. Introduction to Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Tree\n",
    "A tree is made up of nodes that are arranged in a hierarchical structure. At the top of the hierarchy is the root node, which acts as the starting point. All other nodes are connected through edges. The nodes are grouped into levels, and the maximum level of any node in the tree is referred to as the depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fundamental Concepts\n",
    "- **Root Node:** The node at the top of the tree. It is the node from where the whole tree originates. For any tree traversal operation, this node serves as the starting point.\n",
    "- **Nodes:** All the elements in the tree, including the root, are nodes, and each node has a unique value and may have child nodes connected to it.\n",
    "- **Parent Node:** A node in a tree that has one or more child nodes connected to it.\n",
    "- **Child Node:** Nodes that are directly connected to a parent node.\n",
    "- **Sibling Nodes:** Nodes that share the same parent node.\n",
    "- **Ancestor Nodes:** All the nodes in the path from a specific node to the root node.\n",
    "- **Descendant Nodes:** All the nodes reachable from a specific node down to the leaves.\n",
    "- **Leaf Node:** Nodes in the tree that do not have any children.\n",
    "- **Subtree:** A smaller tree within the main tree, consisting of a node and its descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Height and Depth\n",
    "The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to the leaf node. It represents the depth of the tree from the root. In contrast, the depth of a specific node in the tree is the number of edges from the root node to that particular node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Levels in Trees\n",
    "Levels in a tree are defined based on the distance from the root node. The root node is at level 0; its children are at level 1, and so on. The level of a node indicates its generation within the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Level\"](images/tree.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Tree Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Trees\n",
    "1. **Binary Trees:**\n",
    "   Binary trees are a type of tree where each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child. The structure of a binary tree makes it a fundamental and widely used data structure in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Binary Tree Example\"](images/tree_1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full Tree:**\n",
    "   In a full tree, every node has either zero children (leaf node) or two children. There are no nodes with only one child. Full trees are also known as proper binary trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full Tree Example](images/tree_2.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complete Tree:**\n",
    "   A complete tree is a binary tree in which all levels are filled, except possibly the last level. The last level must strictly be filled from left to right. Data structures like Heap use complete binary trees for efficient operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full Tree Example](images/tree_4.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Balanced Tree:**\n",
    "   Balanced trees are binary trees where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node in the tree is not more than 1. This ensures the tree remains reasonably balanced, preventing skewed structures and maintaining optimal search and insertion times.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full Tree Example](images/tree_4.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-way Tree:**\n",
    "   Unlike binary trees, multi-way trees allow nodes to have more than two children. Each node can have multiple branches, making multi-way trees more flexible in representing hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Full Tree Example](images/tree_5.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the different types of trees and their respective examples is essential for choosing the most suitable tree structure for specific applications in computer science and data management.\n"

    "m# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure that organizes elements in a hierarchical manner, allowing for efficient searching, insertion, deletion, and traversal operations. In this section, we will explore the characteristics of a BST, its benefits, applications, ADT operations, time and space complexity, as well as potential issues and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition and Characteristics of BST\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The BST follows a specific property: for any given node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than or equal to the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binary Search Tree Example](images/bst.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the tree satisfies the BST property since, for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits and Applications of BST\n",
    "\n",
    "BSTs provide efficient searching operations due to their hierarchical structure and the BST property. The search can be performed in O(log n) time in a balanced BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Searching:** BSTs provide fast searching capabilities with an average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees. This makes them suitable for applications that require quick data retrieval based on a key, such as database indexing and dictionary implementations.\n",
    "- **Ordered Data Storage:** The inherent order of BSTs makes them suitable for scenarios where data needs to be stored in a sorted manner. For example, BSTs can maintain sorted lists or retrieve elements in a particular order.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree in Databases:** BSTs are used in databases to create indexes that allow for faster data retrieval based on specific fields. Using BSTs for indexing, databases can efficiently handle large datasets and complex queries.\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree in File Systems:** File systems often use BSTs to organize and manage directory structures. The hierarchical nature of BSTs aligns well with the hierarchical structure of directories, enabling efficient file retrieval.\n"

    "\n",
    "Determine the depth (or height) of a binary tree, which refers to the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node to the farthest leaf node. If the tree is empty, the depth is 0.\n",

    "**Output:** 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The longest path is 1->2->4 or 1->2->5 with 3 nodes.\n",

    "**Input:**\n",

    "**Justification:** The longest path is 1->2->7->9 with 4 nodes.\n",

    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].\n",
    "- -100 <= Node.val <= 100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's the 'Depth'?\n",
    "\n",
    "Picture a ladder. Each step is a level in our tree. The depth? It's just how many steps there are! If we have a 3-step ladder, our tree has a depth of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the deepest level of a binary tree, we'll use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Begin at the root node and traverse down each branch, keeping track of the current depth. The depth increases by one each time we move to a child node. If a node is a leaf (no children), compare its depth with the current maximum depth and update if necessary. Recursively apply this process to each node's left and right children. This will cover all paths in the tree, allowing us to find and return the maximum depth encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breaking Down the Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Approach:** The depth of a binary tree can be computed recursively. The maximum depth of a tree is the maximum of the depths of its left and right subtrees plus one (the root node).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Condition:** If the node is null, return 0. This ensures that we've reached the end of a branch or the tree is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Calculation:** For each node, compute the depth of its left subtree and the depth of its right subtree. The depth of the current node is 1 + the maximum of these two depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** For the root node, this recursive approach will provide the maximum depth of the entire tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   3\n",
    " / \n",
    "4 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the root node which has value 1.\n",
    "2. The left subtree has a depth of:\n",
    "   - 1 (for node 2) + max(depth of left subtree of node 2, depth of right subtree of node 2)\n",
    "   - This is equal to 1 + 1 (for node 4) = 2.\n",
    "3. The right subtree of the root node has depth 1 (just node 3).\n",
    "4. So, the maximum depth of the tree is 1 (for the root node) + max(2, 1) = 3.\n",

If the current node is null, return 0, as there's nothing to add. For nodes within the range, add their value to the sum. Since it's a BST, if the current node's value is greater than high, there's no need to explore its right subtree, as all values there will be greater. Similarly, if the current node's value is less than low, ignore its left subtree. This selective traversal reduces the number of nodes visited, optimizing the process.\n",

    "4. **Traversal Decisions:** Utilize the properties of BST for traversal decisions:\n",

    "   - If the current node's value is less than R, we should check its right child as there might be values in the right subtree within the range.\n",
    "5. **Summation:** Keep a running sum of all node values that are within the specified range.\n",

    "The most intuitive approach to this problem is to perform an in-order traversal on the BST. Given the nature of BSTs, an in-order traversal will result in a sequence of nodes in ascending order. Thus, by collecting the nodes in a list during traversal, the kth element of this list would be our answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a more efficient approach. We don't necessarily need to traverse the entire BST. We can halt our in-order traversal as soon as we've visited the kth node. This is achieved by using a counter that's incremented every time we visit a node during our traversal. When the counter matches 'k', we've found our kth smallest element.\n",

    "To solve the problem, initialize the closest value with the root node's value. Then, iteratively traverse the tree, comparing the target with the current node's value. If the target is closer to the current node than the closest value found so far, update the closest value. Depending on whether the target is greater or smaller than the current node's value, move to the right or left child, respectively. This process continues until all nodes are traversed.\n",

    "To solve this problem, we can leverage the properties of a BST. As we traverse the BST, we'll always choose the path that brings us closer to the target value. As we're doing so, we'll keep track of the closest node value we've encountered so far.\n",

    "3. Return `closestVal` after traversing the tree.\n",

    "   - If `root1` is null, return `root2`.\n",
    "   - If `root2` is null, return `root1`.\n",
    "2. **Node Value Summation:**\n",
    "   - If both `root1` and `root2` are not null, create a new node with a value equal to the sum of `root1` and `root2`'s values.\n",
    "3. **Recursive Calls for Child Nodes:**\n",
    "   - Recursively call `mergeTrees` for the left children of `root1` and `root2`, and set the left child of the new node to the result of this recursive call.\n",
    "   - Similarly, recursively call `mergeTrees` for the right children of `root1` and `root2`, and set the right child of the new node to the result.\n",
    "4. **Return the Merged Node:**\n",
    "   - The new node now represents the merged result of `root1` and `root2` at this position in the tree. Return this node.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root Nodes (1 and 1):**\n",
    "   - Both roots are not null, create a new node with sum: 1 + 1 = 2.\n",
    "   - Recursively merge left and right children.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Left Children (2 and 2):**\n",
    "   - Both nodes are not null, create a new node with sum: 2 + 2 = 4.\n",
    "   - Merge left's left children (4 and null):\n",
    "     - Since second node is null, return first node (4).\n",
    "   - Merge left's right children (5 and 5):\n",
    "     - Both nodes are not null, create a new node with sum: 5 + 5 = 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Right Children (3 and 3):**\n",
    "   - Both nodes are not null, create a new node with sum: 3 + 3 = 6.\n",
    "   - Merge left and right children (both null).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Construct the Merged Tree:**\n",
    "   - Using the new nodes created during merging, the final merged tree is constructed as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion will terminate once all nodes in both trees have been traversed. The return value of the initial call to `mergeTrees` will be the root of the newly merged binary tree."
