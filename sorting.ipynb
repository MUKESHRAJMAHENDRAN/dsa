    "## Apple Redistribution into Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array `apple` of size `n`, where `apple[i]` represents the number of apples in the `i-th` pack. You are also given an array `capacity` of size `m`, where `capacity[j]` is the number of apples that can be stored in the `j-th` box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of boxes you need to use to put all `n` packs of apples into boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You are allowed to distribute apples from the same pack into different boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** `apple = [2, 3, 1]`, `capacity = [4, 2, 5, 1]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `2`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Box 1 can take apples from packs 1 and 2 partially (totaling 5 apples), and Box 2 can take the rest of 2 apples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** `apple = [4, 5, 6]`, `capacity = [5, 10]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `2`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Box 1 can take apples from packs 1 and 2 partially (totaling 5 apples), and Box 2 can take the rest of pack 2 and all of pack 3 apples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** `apple = [1, 2, 5, 6]`, `capacity = [2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 2, 4]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `3`\n",
    "- **Explanation:** We can use boxes of size 7, 5, and 2 to pack all apples in boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= n == apple.length <= 50`\n",
    "- `1 <= m == capacity.length <= 50`\n",
    "- `1 <= apple[i], capacity[i] <= 50`\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is generated such that it's possible to redistribute packs of apples into boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use a sorting approach. The core idea is to efficiently distribute apples into boxes by always attempting to fill the largest capacity box available. This approach is believed to be effective because filling the largest boxes first reduces the number of boxes needed faster, akin to fitting the largest pieces into a puzzle first.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by sorting the `capacity` array in descending order so we can always access the largest box first. The apples from each pack will be allocated starting from the box with the highest capacity, using a priority queue to manage and update the available space in the boxes quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the `capacity` array** in ascending order to strategically use the largest boxes last.\n",
    "2. **Initialize a variable `totalApples`** to accumulate the total number of apples that need to be boxed.\n",
    "3. **Iterate over the `apples` array** to calculate `totalApples` by adding up all the apples in the packs.\n",
    "4. **Initialize an index `i`** to the last position of the `capacity` array to start using boxes from the largest to the smallest.\n",
    "5. **Use a while loop to distribute apples into boxes:**\n",
    "   - Subtract the capacity of the box at index `i` from `totalApples`.\n",
    "   - Decrement the index `i` to move to the next largest box.\n",
    "   - Continue this process until all apples are distributed (`totalApples <= 0`) or there are no more boxes (`i < 0`).\n",
    "6. **Calculate the number of boxes used,** which is the difference between the total number of boxes and the boxes that were not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the input: `apple = [1, 2, 5, 6]`, `capacity = [2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 2, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Original `capacity` =** `[2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 2, 4]`. **Sorted `capacity` =** `[2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7]`\n",
    "2. **Initialize `totalApples` =** `0`.\n",
    "3. **Process apples:**\n",
    "   - Adding apples from pack 1: `totalApples = 1`\n",
    "   - Adding apples from pack 2: `totalApples = 3`\n",
    "   - Adding apples from pack 3: `totalApples = 8`\n",
    "   - Adding apples from pack 4: `totalApples = 14`\n",
    "4. **Initialize index `i` =** `6` (last index of `capacity`).\n",
    "5. **Begin distributing apples:**\n",
    "   - Using box with capacity `7`: `totalApples = 14 - 7 = 7`\n",
    "   - Decrement `i` = `5`\n",
    "   - Using box with capacity `5`: `totalApples = 7 - 5 = 2`\n",
    "   - Decrement `i` = `4`\n",
    "   - Using box with capacity `4`: `totalApples = 2 - 4 = -2` (all apples distributed, and extra capacity remains)\n",
    "6. **Calculate boxes used:**\n",
    "   - Initially, `i` = `6`\n",
    "   - Final `i` = `4`\n",
    "   - Boxes used = `6 - 4 + 1 = 3`"

    "Sure! QuickSort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements. Here's a detailed explanation of QuickSort along with the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide**:\n",
    "   - Choose a pivot element from the array.\n",
    "   - Partition the array into two sub-arrays:\n",
    "     - Elements less than or equal to the pivot.\n",
    "     - Elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conquer**:\n",
    "   - Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combine**:\n",
    "   - The base case for recursion is when the sub-array has zero or one element, in which case it is already sorted.\n",
    "   - Combine the sorted sub-arrays and pivot to get the final sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in QuickSort\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choosing a Pivot**:\n",
    "   - A pivot can be chosen in different ways:\n",
    "     - First element\n",
    "     - Last element\n",
    "     - Random element\n",
    "     - Median element\n",
    "   - A common strategy is to choose the last element as the pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partitioning**:\n",
    "   - Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, elements greater than the pivot are on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursively Sorting**:\n",
    "   - Apply the same steps to the left and right sub-arrays created by the partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### QuickSort Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a Python implementation of QuickSort:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def quicksort(arr):\n",
    "    # Base case: an array of zero or one elements is already sorted\n",
    "    if len(arr) <= 1:\n",
    "        return arr\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Choosing the pivot (here we choose the last element)\n",
    "    pivot = arr[-1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Partition the array into two halves\n",
    "    less_than_pivot = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x <= pivot]\n",
    "    greater_than_pivot = [x for x in arr[:-1] if x > pivot]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Recursively apply quicksort to the partitions and combine them with the pivot\n",
    "    return quicksort(less_than_pivot) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater_than_pivot)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\n",
    "sorted_arr = quicksort(arr)\n",
    "print(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-place QuickSort Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The above implementation is straightforward but not in-place (it uses additional memory). Here’s an in-place version of QuickSort using the Lomuto partition scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def quicksort_inplace(arr, low, high):\n",
    "    if low < high:\n",
    "        # Partition the array and get the pivot index\n",
    "        pi = partition(arr, low, high)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Recursively sort elements before and after partition\n",
    "        quicksort_inplace(arr, low, pi - 1)\n",
    "        quicksort_inplace(arr, pi + 1, high)\n",
    "\n",
    "def partition(arr, low, high):\n",
    "    pivot = arr[high]\n",
    "    i = low - 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for j in range(low, high):\n",
    "        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n",
    "            i += 1\n",
    "            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n",
    "    return i + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\n",
    "quicksort_inplace(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n",
    "print(arr)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: \n",
    "  - Average case: `O(n log n)`\n",
    "  - Worst case: `O(n^2)` (when the pivot is the smallest or largest element repeatedly, which can be mitigated with randomized pivoting)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Not in-place version: `O(n)` due to additional arrays.\n",
    "  - In-place version: `O(log n)` for the recursion stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "QuickSort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets. It’s important to understand both the simple version and the in-place version, as the latter is more space-efficient and typically preferred in real-world applications."

    "For example, if `s` is \"leetcode\", the output should be \"leotcede\" because the vowels 'e', 'e', 'e', 'o' in `s` are sorted to 'e', 'e', 'o', 'e' in the new string `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The key intuition behind the solution is to separate the vowels from the consonants, sort the vowels according to their ASCII values, and then merge them back into the original string in their proper index locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separating Vowels from Consonants**: We go through the string `s` and create a list of vowels. This is done by checking if each character is a vowel (for simplicity, by checking if it's in the string \"aeiou\" after converting to lowercase to ensure that both uppercase and lowercase vowels are considered).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sorting Vowels**: Once we have a list that contains only the vowels from the original string, we sort this list. This sorted list now represents the order that the vowels should appear in the final string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merging Vowels Back**: Keeping a separate copy of the original string allows us to know the positions of the consonants, so we can replace the vowels in this copy with the sorted vowels. We iterate through the copy of the original string and each time we encounter a vowel, we take the next vowel from our sorted vowels list and replace it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Converting to String**: Finally, we join the list into a string and return this as our final sorted string with the vowel positions permuted according to their ASCII values and consonants in their initial places.\n"

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the given problem is to perform a series of operations on an integer array `nums` until all the elements in the array are equal. An operation consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find the largest value in the array**, denoted as `largest`. If there are multiple elements with the largest value, we select the one with the smallest index `i`.\n",
    "2. **Find the next largest value** that is strictly smaller than `largest`, denoted as `nextLargest`.\n",
    "3. **Replace the element at index `i` with `nextLargest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem asks us to return the number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, a key insight is that sorting the array will make it easier to track the reductions needed to equalize all elements. After sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The largest element will be at the end of the sorted array, and the next largest will be right before it.\n",
    "- Subsequent steps involve moving down the sorted array and reducing the largest remaining element to the next largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining a sorted array, we can avoid repeatedly searching for the largest and next largest elements, thus optimizing the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the process of the solution approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First, sort the array** in non-decreasing order. This will ensure that each subsequent value from left to right will be greater than or equal to the previous one.\n",
    "2. Then, **iterate through the sorted array** from the second element onwards, comparing the current element with the previous one:\n",
    "    - If they are the same, no operation is needed for this step, but we keep a count of how many times we would have had to reduce other elements to the current value.\n",
    "    - If the current value is larger, it means an operation was needed to get from the previous value to this one. We increment the operation count (`cnt`) and add it to the total answer (`ans`) because we will need that number of operations for each element that needs to be reduced to this current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each increment of `cnt` represents a step in which all larger elements need one more operation to reach equality, and by adding `cnt` to the answer every time, you account for the operations needed to reduce all larger elements to the current one. The final answer is the total count of operations needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The given Python solution follows a straightforward approach, leveraging simple algorithms and data structure manipulation to arrive at the answer. Here's a breakdown of how the solution is implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**: The primary algorithm used here is sorting, which is an integral part of the solution. Python's built-in sorting is typically implemented as Timsort, which is efficient for the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structures**: The solution primarily works with the list data structure in Python, which is essentially an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Used**: The approach follows a pattern similar to counting, where for each unique value in the sorted array, we track how many operations are needed if we want to reduce the larger numbers to this number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the implementation step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `nums` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `nums.sort()`.\n",
    "2. A for loop with `enumerate` is set to iterate through the array (excluding the first element, as there’s nothing to compare it to). Two variables are maintained:\n",
    "    - `cnt`: This keeps count of how many different operations are performed. It starts at 0 because no operations are performed at the first element.\n",
    "    - `ans`: This accumulates the total number of operations.\n",
    "3. Inside the loop, each element `v` at index `i` (where `i` starts from 1 since we skipped the first element) is compared to its predecessor (`nums[i]`):\n",
    "    - If `v` equals the previous element (`nums[i]`), it means that no new operation is needed for `v` to become equal to the previous element (as it's already equal).\n",
    "    - If `v` is different (meaning it is larger since the array is sorted), then we found a new value that wasn't seen before. Therefore, we increment `cnt` by 1 since all occurrences of this new value would require an additional operation to be reduced to the previous smaller value.\n",
    "4. After assessing each pair of elements, the value of `cnt` (which indicates the cumulative operations required to reduce the current and all previous larger values) is added to `ans`.\n",
    "5. Finally, after the loop completes, `ans` holds the total number of operations required to make all elements equal and is returned as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the critical part of the code with added comments for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def reductionOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n",
    "        nums.sort()  # Sorting the array in non-decreasing order\n",
    "        ans = cnt = 0  # Initialize counters to zero\n",
    "        for i, v in enumerate(nums[1:]):  # Iterate through the array, skipping the first element\n",
    "            if v != nums[i]:  # If current element is greater than the previous one (not equal)\n",
    "                cnt += 1  # Increment the number of operations needed\n",
    "            ans += cnt  # Add to total answer\n",
    "        return ans  # Return the total\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `enumerate` function in the loop is used with the sublist `nums[1:]` which effectively shifts the indices of the enumerated items by one, meaning `nums[i]` actually refers to the element immediately preceding `v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the use of sorting simplifies the identification of unique values that require operations, and the counting mechanism properly aggregates the steps needed to reach the desired equal state of the `nums` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a small example using the solution approach described above. Consider the following array of integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "`nums = [5, 1, 3, 3, 5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to perform operations until all the elements in this array are equal, following the given steps: sort the array, identify the largest and next largest elements, and replace occurrences of the largest element with the next largest until the array is homogenized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the breakdown of how we apply our algorithm to the example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sort the array:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort the `nums` array: `nums = [1, 3, 3, 5, 5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting the array in non-decreasing order, we can easily identify which elements need to be replaced in each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial setup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize our counters: `cnt = 0` and `ans = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start iterating from the second element of `nums` (since we need to compare each element with its previous one).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare 3 with 1. Since 3 is greater, we found a new value. So, `cnt` becomes 1 and `ans` becomes 1.\n",
    "- Compare the second 3 with the first 3. They are equal, no new operation is needed, `cnt` stays 1 and `ans` becomes 2.\n",
    "- Compare 5 with 3. 5 is greater, so `cnt` becomes 2 (indicating each 5 needs two operations to become a 3) and `ans` becomes 4.\n",
    "- Compare the second 5 with the first 5. They are equal, so `cnt` stays 2 and `ans` becomes 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final count:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop concludes, `ans = 6`, which represents the total number of operations needed to make all elements equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this walkthrough, we find that a total of 6 operations are required to make all elements of the array `[5, 1, 3, 3, 5]` equal. The sorted form, `[1, 3, 3, 5, 5]`, simplifies the identification of which elements need to be replaced, and our counting mechanism effectively calculates the necessary steps to achieve uniformity across the array."

    "## Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we're given an array of integers, `nums`, with a size `n` and a positive integer `k`. The objective is to split this array into one or more subarrays where each subarray has exactly 3 elements. There are certain conditions that we have to follow when creating these subarrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each element from the original array must be used once and only once—this means that each element in `nums` must be put into exactly one subarray.\n",
    "2. For any given subarray, the difference between the largest and smallest values within that subarray can't be greater than `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to return a 2D array with all the constructed subarrays that fit these criteria. If it's not possible to divide the array under these conditions, we must return an empty array. Also, if there are multiple ways to divide the array that fit the requirements, we are free to return any one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, a straightforward approach is to first impose an order by sorting the array. Once sorted, we can confidently compare adjacent elements knowing that they represent the nearest possible grouping by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting the array, we start taking chunks of three elements at a time from the start since we're required to have subarrays of size three. For each set of three elements, we inspect the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element. Because the array is sorted, these elements will be the first and the last in the chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the difference exceeds `k`, then we know it's not possible to divide the array while satisfying the conditions (because a sorted array ensures that this set of three has the smallest possible maximum difference). Therefore, we can terminate early and return an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the difference is within `k`, this grouping is valid, and we can add it to the list of answers. We repeat this process, moving forward in the array by three elements each time until we've successfully created subarrays out of all elements in `nums`. The solution approach ensures that we consider each element exactly once and check for the condition without any backtracking, thus providing an efficient and correct way of dividing the array into subarrays, or determining if it cannot be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the solution uses a straightforward algorithm and the basic data structure of arrays (or lists in Python). The key pattern used here is sorting, which is a common first step in a variety of problems to arrange elements in a non-decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the array**: We apply a built-in sorting function to the `nums` array, rearranging its elements in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily check the difference between the smallest and largest numbers in any subsequent groups of three.\n",
    "2. **Initialize the answer list**: An empty list `ans` is initialized to store the valid subarrays if we can form them.\n",
    "3. **Iterate through the array in chunks of three**: The sorted `nums` array is traversed using a `for`-loop with a step of 3 in `range(0, n, 3)`. Each iteration corresponds to a potential subarray.\n",
    "4. **Check the difference constraint**: In the loop, we take a slice of the array from index `i` to `i + 3`, which includes three elements. We then check if the difference between the last element (which is the maximum because of sorting) and the first element (which is the minimum) exceeds `k`.\n",
    "5. **Violation of the constraint**: If this difference is greater than `k`, we know it is impossible to form a subarray that meets the condition, and therefore an empty array is immediately returned, as it indicates that we cannot divide the array successfully.\n",
    "6. **Constraint satisfied**: If the difference does not exceed `k`, this slice of three elements is a valid subarray, and we add it to the answer list `ans`.\n",
    "7. **Return the result**: Once the loop has finished and no constraint has been violated, we return the `ans` list, which contains all successfully formed subarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this process, no additional data structures are needed other than the input array and the output list. The time complexity of the algorithm is primarily driven by the sorting step, which is typically `O(n log n)`. Since traversing the sorted array and checking for the conditions is done in linear time — `O(n)` — the total time complexity remains `O(n log n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is elegant in its simplicity, using a commonly understood and implemented pattern of sorting, and demonstrates the power of transforming a problem space to make conditions easier to verify.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a small example to illustrate the solution approach using the algorithm described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our input array is `nums = [4, 8, 2, 7, 6, 1, 9]` and `k = 3`. We want to create subarrays with exactly 3 elements each where the difference between the maximum and smallest values in a subarray should not exceed `k`. Let's follow the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the array**: We sort `nums` to get `[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.\n",
    "2. **Initialize the answer list**: We create an empty list `ans = []` to hold our subarrays.\n",
    "3. **Iterate through the array in chunks of three**: We consider subarrays `nums[0:3]`, `nums[3:6]`, and `nums[6:9]`. These are `[1, 2, 4]`, `[6, 7, 8]`, and the single element `[9]` left out (which can't form a subarray of size three).\n",
    "4. **Check the difference constraint**:\n",
    "   - For the first subarray `[1, 2, 4]`, the difference between `4` (max) and `1` (min) is `3`, which is equal to `k`, so this subarray is valid. We add `[1, 2, 4]` to `ans`.\n",
    "   - For the second subarray `[6, 7, 8]`, the difference between `8` (max) and `6` (min) is `2`, which is less than `k`, so this subarray is also valid. We add `[6, 7, 8]` to `ans`.\n",
    "   - The last element `[9]` cannot form a subarray because there are not enough elements to make a set of three. However, had it been possible to create another subarray with exactly 3 elements, we would have checked it following the same method.\n",
    "5. **Return the result**: We finish the loop and return `ans` which now contains `[[1, 2, 4], [6, 7, 8]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the key takeaways from the example are:\n",
    "- Sorting the array helps us group the nearest numbers together and check if they satisfy the condition.\n",
    "- Since the array is processed in sorted order, if any subset of three elements doesn't satisfy the condition, we can immediately conclude that it's not possible to split the array as required, because any other grouping would only increase the difference.\n",
    "- The entire process requires only the sorted array and an additional list to store valid subarrays, which is very space-efficient.\n",
    "- The resulting subarrays from our example adhere to the rules of the problem, and the example has demonstrated how the algorithm successfully applies the concepts described in the solution approach."

    "# Problem Description\n",
    "The LeetCode problem provides us with an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Our task is to find the `k` most frequent elements in the array. The \"frequency\" of an element is the number of times it occurs in the array. The problem specifies that we can return the result in any order, which means the sequence of the results does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "To solve this problem, we need to count the occurrences of each element and then find the `k` elements with the highest frequencies. The natural approach is to use a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to achieve the frequency count efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the frequency of each element, we want to retrieve the `k` elements with the highest frequency. A common data structure to maintain the `k` largest or smallest elements is a heap. In Python, we use a min-heap by default, which ensures that the smallest element is always at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count the frequency of each element using a hash map.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the frequency map, adding each element along with its frequency as a tuple to a min-heap.\n",
    "3. If the heap exceeds size `k`, we remove the smallest item, which is automatically done because of the heap's properties. This ensures we only keep the `k` most frequent elements in the heap.\n",
    "4. After processing all elements, we're left with a heap containing `k` elements with the highest frequency.\n",
    "5. We convert this heap into a list containing just the elements (not the frequencies) to return as our final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is highly efficient as it allows us to keep only the `k` most frequent elements at all times without having to sort the entire frequency map, which could be much larger than `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "The implementation of the solution uses Python's `Counter` class from the `collections` module to calculate the frequency of each element in the `nums` array. `Counter` is essentially a hash map or a dictionary that maps each element to its frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we use `Counter(nums)` to create a frequency map that holds the count of each number in the `nums` array.\n",
    "2. Next, we initialize an empty min-heap `hp` as a list to store tuples of the form `(frequency, num)`, where frequency is the frequency of the number `num` in the array.\n",
    "3. We iterate over each item in the frequency map and add a tuple `(freq, num)` to the heap using the `heappush` function.\n",
    "4. While we add elements to the heap, we maintain the size of the heap to not exceed `k`. If adding an element causes the heap size to become greater than `k`, we pop the smallest item from the heap using `heappop`. This is done to keep only the `k` most frequent elements in the heap.\n",
    "5. After we finish processing all elements, the heap contains `k` tuples representing the `k` most frequent elements. The least frequent element is on the top of the min-heap, while the k-th most frequent element is the last one in the heap's binary tree representation.\n",
    "6. Finally, we build the result list by extracting the `num` from each tuple `(freq, num)` in the heap using a list comprehension: `[v[1] for v in hp]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Counter` efficiently calculates the frequencies of each element in O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the input array. The heap operations (insertion and removal) work in O(log k) time, and since we perform these operations at most `n` times, the total time complexity of the heap operations is O(n log k). Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log k), with O(n) coming from the frequency map creation and O(n log k) from the heap operations. The space complexity of the solution is O(n) to store the frequency map and the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This efficient implementation ensures we're not doing unnecessary work by keeping only the top `k` frequencies in the heap, and it avoids having to sort large sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Walkthrough\n",
    "Let's use a small example to illustrate the solution approach. Consider the array `nums = [1,2,3,2,1,2]` and `k = 2`. Our goal is to find the 2 most frequent elements in `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first use `Counter(nums)` to create a frequency map. This gives us `{1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 1}` where the key is the number from `nums` and the value is its frequency.\n",
    "2. We initialize an empty min-heap `hp`. It's going to store tuples like `(frequency, num)`.\n",
    "3. We iterate over the frequency map and add each `num` and its frequency to `hp`. For example, `(2, 1)` for the number `1` with a frequency of `2`. We use `heappush` to add the tuples to `hp`, so after this step `hp` might have `[(1, 3), (2, 1)]`.\n",
    "4. The heap should not exceed the size `k`. In our case, `k` is 2, which means after we add the third element `(3, 2)`, we need to pop the smallest frequency. So we end up with `hp` as `[(2, 1), (3, 2)]` after all the operations since `(1, 3)` would be the popped element because it had the lowest frequency.\n",
    "5. The heap now contains the tuples for the 2 most frequent elements. The tuple with the smallest frequency is at the top, ensuring that less frequent elements have been popped off when the size limit was exceeded.\n",
    "6. Finally, to build our result list, we extract the number from each tuple in the heap. Using list comprehension `[v[1] for v in hp]` we get `[1, 2]`, which are the elements with the highest frequency. This is our final result and we can return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this approach, we implemented an efficient solution to the problem that avoids sorting the entire frequency map directly and instead maintains a heap of size `k` to track the `k` most frequent elements."

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem presents a scenario where we have an array of meeting time intervals, each represented by a pair of numbers [start_i, end_i]. These pairs indicate when a meeting starts and ends. The goal is to find the minimum number of conference rooms required to accommodate all these meetings without any overlap. In other words, we want to allocate space such that no two meetings occur in the same room simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind the solution is to track the changes in room occupancy over time, which is akin to tracking the number of trains at a station at any given time. We can visualize the timeline from the start of the first meeting to the end of the last meeting, and keep a counter that increments when a meeting starts and decrements when a meeting ends. This approach is similar to the sweep line algorithm, often used in computational geometry to keep track of changes over time or another dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iterating through all the meetings, we apply these increments/decrements at the respective start and end times. The maximum value reached by this counter at any point in time represents the peak occupancy, thus indicating the minimum number of conference rooms needed. To implement this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We initialize an array `delta` that is large enough to span all potential meeting times. We use a fixed size in this solution, which assumes the meeting times fall within a predefined range (0 to 1000009 in this case).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Iterate through the intervals list, and for each meeting interval [start, end], increment the value at index `start` in the `delta` array, and decrement the value at index `end`. This effectively marks the start of a meeting with +1 (indicating a room is now occupied) and the end of a meeting with -1 (a room has been vacated).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accumulate the changes in the `delta` array using the `accumulate` function, which applies a running sum over the array elements. The maximum number reached in this accumulated array is our answer, as it represents the highest number of simultaneous meetings, i.e., the minimum number of conference rooms required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is efficient because it avoids the need to sort the meetings by their start or end times, and it provides a direct way to calculate the running sum of room occupancy over the entire timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution uses a simple array and the concept of the prefix sum (running sum) to keep track of room occupancy over time—an approach that is both space-efficient and does not require complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: A large array `delta` is created with all elements initialized to 0. The size of the array is chosen to be large enough to handle all potential meeting times (1 more than the largest possible time to account for the last meeting's end time). In this case, 1000010 is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Updating the `delta` Array**: For each meeting interval, say [start, end], we treat the start time as the point where a new room is needed (increment counter) and the end time as the point where a room is freed (decrement counter).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for start, end in intervals:\n",
    "       delta[start] += 1\n",
    "       delta[end] -= 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This creates a timeline indicating when rooms are occupied and vacated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating the Prefix Sum**: We use the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module of Python to create a running sum (also known as a prefix sum) over the `delta` array. The result is a new array indicating the number of rooms occupied at each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   occupied_rooms_over_time = accumulate(delta)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding the Maximum Occupancy**: The peak of the `occupied_rooms_over_time` array represents the maximum number of rooms simultaneously occupied, hence the minimum number of rooms we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   min_rooms_required = max(occupied_rooms_over_time)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `max` function is used to find this peak value, which completes our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this approach is in its simplicity and efficiency. Instead of worrying about sorting meetings by starts or ends or using complex data structures like priority queues, we leverage the fact that when we are only interested in the max count, the order of increments and decrements on the timeline does not matter. As long as we correctly increment at the start times and decrement at the end times, the `accumulate` function ensures we get a correct count at each time point.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a small set of meeting intervals to illustrate the solution approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meeting intervals**: `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [7, 9]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have three meetings. The first meeting starts at time 1 and ends at time 4, the second meeting starts at time 2 and ends at time 5, and the third meeting starts at time 7 and ends at time 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the solution steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: We create an array `delta` of size 1000010, which is a bit overkill for this small example, but let's go with the provided approach. Initially, all elements in `delta` are set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating the `delta` Array**: We iterate through the meeting intervals and update the `delta` array accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  delta[1] += 1   # Meeting 1 starts, need a room\n",
    "  delta[4] -= 1   # Meeting 1 ends, free a room\n",
    "  delta[2] += 1   # Meeting 2 starts, need a room\n",
    "  delta[5] -= 1   # Meeting 2 ends, free a room\n",
    "  delta[7] += 1   # Meeting 3 starts, need a room\n",
    "  delta[9] -= 1   # Meeting 3 ends, free a room\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  After the updates, the `delta` array will reflect changes in room occupancy at the start and end times of the meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculating the Prefix Sum**: Using an `accumulate` operation (similar to a running sum), we calculate the number of rooms occupied at each point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```plaintext\n",
    "  time     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n",
    "  delta    +1 +1  0 -1 -1  0 +1  0 -1\n",
    "  occupied  1  2  2  1  0  0  1  1  0   (summing up `delta` changes over time)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",

    "The provided Python code determines the minimum number of meeting rooms required for a set of meetings, represented by their start and end times. The time complexity of the code is determined by three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Initializing the `delta` list, which has a fixed length of 1000010. This step is in O(1) since it does not depend on the number of intervals but on a constant size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Populating `delta` Array:** The first for loop iterates through the intervals to populate the `delta` array with +1 and -1 for the start and end times of meetings. It runs O(n) times, where n is the number of intervals (meetings).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accumulate Operation:** Using `accumulate` to calculate the prefix sum of the `delta` array. In the worst case, this operation is O(m), where m is the size of the `delta` array, which is a constant of 1000010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the final time complexity is dominated by the larger of the two variables, which is the constant time for using `accumulate`, the overall time complexity is O(m). However, since m is a constant (1000010), the time complexity effectively simplifies to O(1).\n",

    "No additional data structures that grow with the size of the input are used, maintaining a space complexity of O(1).\n",
