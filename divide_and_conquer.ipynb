    "The divide and conquer algorithm can be used to find the majority element in an array efficiently. The strategy involves recursively dividing the array into two halves until each segment contains a single element. At this base level, a single element is trivially the majority of its one-element segment. As we merge these segments back together, we determine the majority element of each merged segment by comparing the counts of the majority elements from the two halves. The majority element of the entire array is the one that remains the majority as segments are progressively merged.\n",

    "- Store the returned values from both halves, which are potential majority elements for each half.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conquer Step:**\n",
    "- If the majority element found in the left half is the same as the one in the right half, return this element as the majority element for the current segment.\n",
    "- If they are different, count the occurrences of each within the current segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combine Step:**\n",
    "- Compare the counts of these two elements.\n",
    "- Return the element that has a higher count within the current segment. If the counts are equal, either can be returned as the majority element for this segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End Function:** Return the majority element of the array.\n",

    "\n",
    "A substring is considered nice if for every lowercase letter in the substring, its uppercase counterpart is also present, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no such string exists, return an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 1:**\n",
    "  - **Input:** \"BbCcXxY\"\n",
    "  - **Expected Output:** \"BbCcXx\"\n",
    "  - **Justification:** Here, \"BbCcXx\" is the longest substring where each letter's uppercase and lowercase forms are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 2:**\n",
    "  - **Input:** \"aZAbcD\"\n",
    "  - **Expected Output:** \"\"\n",
    "  - **Justification:** There is no contiguous substring where each character exists in both its uppercase and lowercase forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 3:**\n",
    "  - **Input:** \"qQwWeErR\"\n",
    "  - **Expected Output:** \"qQwWeErR\"\n",
    "  - **Justification:** The entire string is the longest nice substring since every letter exists in both uppercase and lowercase forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "- 1 <= str.length <= 100\n",
    "- `str` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, you can use a straightforward approach. First, check if the entire string is 'nice', which means it has each letter in both uppercase and lowercase. If it's not, then you start breaking the string into smaller parts. You do this by dividing the string around each character, creating two new segments each time: one on the left and one on the right of that character.\n",
    "\n",
    "This splitting helps you explore every possible combination to find a 'nice' substring. For each of these smaller strings, you apply the same 'nice' criteria. If a substring qualifies, compare its length with your current longest 'nice' substring and keep the longer one. Continue this process of dividing and checking each part of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this method, you ensure that no potential 'nice' substring is missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Algorithm\n",

    "- If the string is empty or has a length of 1, it cannot be a nice substring. Return an empty string in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check for Nice Substring:**\n",
    "- Scan the entire string to check if it is a nice substring. This involves checking if, for every lowercase letter, its uppercase counterpart is present and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divide if Not Nice:**\n",
    "- If the current string is not a nice substring, divide the problem. This involves breaking the string into two halves at each character and recursively applying the algorithm on these halves.\n",
    "  - For each character in the string:\n",
    "    - Exclude the character and divide the string into two parts: left and right of the excluded character.\n",
    "    - Recursively call the function on these two parts to find the longest nice substring in each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conquer:**\n",
    "- From the recursive calls, two substrings are returned, one from the left part and one from the right. Compare these substrings based on their lengths.\n",
    "- Choose the longer of the two substrings as the longest nice substring for the current recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combine and Return:**\n",
    "- Continue combining the results of the recursive calls as the execution stack unwinds.\n",
    "- Eventually, return the longest nice substring found for the entire string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "Consider input \"BbCcXxy\".\n",
    "- **Initial Check:**\n",
    "  - Start by checking if the entire string \"BbCcXxY\" is nice. It's not, because 'Y' does not have a lowercase counterpart.\n",
    "- **First Division:**\n",
    "  - Divide the string around each character and recursively process the substrings.\n",
    "  - First division is around 'B': left substring \"\", right substring \"bCcXxY\".\n",
    "  - Continue dividing the right substring.\n",
    "    - Divide around 'b':\n",
    "      - left substring \"B\", right substring \"CcXxY\".\n",
    "      - \"B\" is not nice. Continue with \"CcXxY\".\n",
    "    - Divide around 'C':\n",
    "      - left substring \"Bb\", right substring \"cXxY\".\n",
    "      - \"Bb\" is nice, but keep checking for a longer nice substring. Continue with \"cXxY\".\n",
    "    - Divide around 'c':\n",
    "      - left substring \"BbC\", right substring \"XxY\".\n",
    "      - \"BbC\" is not nice. Continue with \"XxY\".\n",
    "    - Divide around 'X':\n",
    "      - left substring \"BbCc\", right substring \"xY\".\n",
    "      - \"BbCc\" is nice, longer than \"Bb\". Continue with \"xY\".\n",
    "    - Divide around 'x':\n",
    "      - left substring \"BbCcX\", right substring \"Y\".\n",
    "      - \"BbCcX\" is not nice. Continue with \"x\".\n",
    "    - Divide around 'y':\n",
    "      - left substring \"BbCcXx\", right substring \"\".\n",
    "      - \"BbCcXx\" is nice, longer than \"BbCc\".\n",

    "Given a positive integer `N`, construct a beautiful array of size `N` containing the numbers from `1` to `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any three indices `i`, `j`, `k` (with `i < j < k`), `A[j] * 2` is not equal to `A[i] + A[k]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `1 <= n <= 1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, a divide-and-conquer strategy, which focuses on the inherent properties of odd and even numbers, can be used. The fundamental approach is to construct two separate arrays, one consisting entirely of odd numbers and the other of even numbers. The reason for this segregation is rooted in the basic arithmetic property that the sum of an odd and an even number is always odd. Therefore, by ensuring one array contains only odds and the other only evens, we prevent the formation of any triplet `i`, `j`, `k` (with `i < j < k`) for which `A[j] * 2 = A[i] + A[k]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide the Problem:** We divide the problem into creating two smaller 'beautiful' arrays - one for odd and one for even integers. This division is based on the insight that a sum of an odd and an even number is always odd, and thus can never be twice any number in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursive Construction:** We recursively construct these smaller arrays. For a given size `N`, we create beautiful arrays for `N/2` (even numbers) and `(N+1)/2` (odd numbers). During recursion, if `N` becomes `1`, we return `[1]` as the base case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transforming Subarrays:** After obtaining the smaller arrays, we transform them to fit into the larger structure. For the odd array, we multiply each element by 2 and subtract 1. For the even array, we simply multiply each element by 2. This step ensures that the elements in the odd array remain odd and those in the even array remain even.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Merging Arrays:** Finally, we merge the transformed odd and even arrays. This merging is done by concatenating the arrays, as they are already structured to maintain the 'beautiful' property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "For input `N = 8`, the algorithm functions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Division:** We start by dividing the problem into two subproblems - creating a beautiful array for the odd numbers and another for the even numbers. For `N = 8`, we need to create beautiful arrays for `4` (odd numbers) and `4` (even numbers), as `8/2 = 4` and `(8+1)/2 = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Calls for Odds and Evens:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For the odd part (`N = 4`), we recursively call the algorithm. Since `4` is not the base case, we further divide it into `2` (odds) and `2` (evens).\n",
    "  - Similarly, for the even part (`N = 4`), we again call the algorithm recursively and divide it into `2` (odds) and `2` (evens).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Case Resolution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For `N = 2`, the recursive calls reach the base case. The beautiful array for `N = 1` is `[1]`.\n",
    "  - We then transform these base arrays for odds and evens. For odds, `[1]` becomes `[1*2-1] = [1]`, and for evens, `[1]` becomes `[1*2] = [2]`.\n",
    "  - Combining these for each `N = 2` scenario, we get `[1, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building Up from Base Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We now return to the previous recursive step (for `N = 4`). We transform the smaller odd and even arrays (`[1, 2]`) to fit into our larger structure. For odds, `[1, 2]` becomes `[1*2-1, 2*2-1] = [1, 3]` and for evens `[1*2, 2*2] = [2, 4]`.\n",
    "  - We then combine these to form `[1, 3, 2, 4]` for each `N = 4` scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Final Combination:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Finally, for `N = 8`, we merge the two `N = 4` arrays. For the odd array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, we transform it to `[1*2-1, 3*2-1, 2*2-1, 4*2-1] = [1, 5, 3, 7]`. For the even array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`, we transform it to `[1*2, 3*2, 2*2, 4*2] = [2, 6, 4, 8]`.\n",
    "  - Combining these arrays, we get `[1, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 8]`.\n"

    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the median of two sorted arrays, we can use the merge step of the merge sort algorithm and the two-pointer approach. This approach involves merging the elements of both arrays into a single sorted sequence. However, unlike traditional merge sort, we don't need to merge the entire arrays. Instead, we only merge until we reach the median position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median position is determined by the combined size of the arrays, varying if the total number of elements is odd or even. The process involves comparing the elements at the pointer positions and advancing the pointer at the smaller element, thus mimicking a partial merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step continues until the pointers reach the median position. The median is then calculated based on the last elements encountered by the pointers: directly for an odd total and as an average of the last two elements for an even total.\n",

    "1. **Initialize Pointers:** Start with two pointers, one for each array, both initialized to point to the first element of their respective arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Determine Median Position:** Calculate the position of the median in the merged array. If the total number of elements (N) in both arrays is odd, the median is at position (N + 1) / 2. If N is even, the median will be the average of the elements at positions N / 2 and (N / 2) + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simulate Merging:** Begin advancing the pointers through the arrays. At each step, compare the elements at the pointer positions in both arrays. Advance the pointer that points to the smaller element. This step mimics the merge process, but only the elements up to the median position are considered.\n",
