    "## Problem 1: Running Sum of 1d Array (easy)\n",
    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "Given a one-dimensional array of integers, create a new array that represents the running sum of the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The running sum at position i in the new array is calculated as the sum of all the numbers in the original array from the 0th index up to the i-th index (inclusive). Formally, the resulting array should be computed as follows: result[i] = sum(nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i]) for each i from 0 to the length of the array minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "**Input:** [2, 3, 5, 1, 6]  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** [2, 5, 10, 11, 17]  \n",
    "**Justification:**  \n",
    "- For i=0: 2  \n",
    "- For i=1: 2 + 3 = 5  \n",
    "- For i=2: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10  \n",
    "- For i=3: 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11  \n",
    "- For i=4: 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 6 = 17  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "**Input:** [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  \n",
    "**Justification:** Each element is simply the sum of all preceding elements plus the current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3\n",
    "**Input:** [-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** [-1, 1, -2, 2, -3]  \n",
    "**Justification:** Negative numbers are also summed up in the same manner as positive ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n",
    "- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "To find a solution of this problem, we can employ a straightforward approach. Starting from the first element of the input array, we can traverse through each element, cumulatively summing up the values as we proceed and placing the running total at the corresponding index in the resulting array.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Array_1](images/array_1.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Variable for Running Sum:** Start by setting a variable (let's call it `runningSum`) to 0. This variable will keep track of the cumulative sum as you iterate through the array.\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through the Array:** Loop through each element of the array. You can use a standard `for` loop for this purpose.\n",
    "3. **Update Running Sum:** In each iteration, add the current element's value to `runningSum`. This step updates the running total with the value of the current element.\n",
    "4. **Replace Current Element:** After updating the `runningSum`, replace the current element in the array with the value of `runningSum`. This effectively changes each element to the sum of all preceding elements including itself.\n",
    "5. **Continue Until the End of the Array:** Continue steps 3 and 4 for each element in the array. By the end of the loop, each array element will have been replaced with the cumulative sum up to that point.\n",
    "6. **Return the Modified Array:** After completing the iteration through the array, return the modified array. This array now contains the running sums instead of the original values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach guarantees that we traverse through the input array only once, summing up the elements as we go along and avoiding recalculating any previously computed sums. Thus, it is computationally efficient while also being memory-efficient, as we don't store intermediate results in additional data structures.\n"

    "## Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to calculate the absolute difference between the sum of elements to the left and to the right of each element in the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers, `left_sum` and `right_sum`, to track the sums of elements on the left and right sides respectively.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the input list, updating the pointers and calculating the absolute difference for each element.\n",
    "3. Append the absolute differences to a list and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Initialize `left_sum` to 0, representing the sum of elements to the left.\n",
    "   - Initialize `right_sum` to the sum of all elements in the input list, representing the sum of elements to the right.\n",
    "   - Create an empty list `differences` to store the absolute differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Through the List:**\n",
    "   - For each element `num` in the input list:\n",
    "     - Subtract `num` from `right_sum` to update the sum of elements to the right.\n",
    "     - Calculate the absolute difference between `left_sum` and `right_sum` and store it in a variable `difference`.\n",
    "     - Append `difference` to the `differences` list.\n",
    "     - Update `left_sum` by adding `num`, as `num` now moves from the left side to the right side.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning the Result:**\n",
    "   - After iterating through all elements, return the list `differences` containing the absolute differences for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through the first example `[2, 5, 1, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:**\n",
    "  - `left_sum = 0`\n",
    "  - `right_sum = 14` (sum of all elements)\n",
    "  - `differences = []`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 1 (num = 2):**\n",
    "  - `right_sum` becomes `14 - 2 = 12`\n",
    "  - Absolute difference: `|0 - 12| = 12`\n",
    "  - Append `12` to `differences`\n",
    "  - `left_sum` becomes `0 + 2 = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 2 (num = 5):**\n",
    "  - `right_sum` becomes `12 - 5 = 7`\n",
    "  - Absolute difference: `|2 - 7| = 5`\n",
    "  - Append `5` to `differences`\n",
    "  - `left_sum` becomes `2 + 5 = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 3 (num = 1):**\n",
    "  - `right_sum` becomes `7 - 1 = 6`\n",
    "  - Absolute difference: `|7 - 6| = 1`\n",
    "  - Append `1` to `differences`\n",
    "  - `left_sum` becomes `7 + 1 = 8`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iteration 4 (num = 6):**\n",
    "  - `right_sum` becomes `6 - 6 = 0`\n",
    "  - Absolute difference: `|8 - 0| = 8`\n",
    "  - Append `8` to `differences`\n",
    "  - `left_sum` becomes `8 + 6 = 14`\n",

    "\n",
    "A bike rider is going on a ride. The road contains \\( n + 1 \\) points at different altitudes. The rider starts from point 0 at an altitude of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers `gain` of length \\( n \\), where `gain[i]` represents the net gain in altitude between points \\( i \\) and \\( i + 1 \\) for all \\( 0 \\leq i < n \\), return the highest altitude of a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `gain = [-5, 1, 5, 0, -7]`  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** 1  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** The altitude changes are \\([-5, -4, 1, 1, -6]\\), where 1 is the highest altitude reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `gain = [4, -3, 2, -1, -2]`  \n",
    "**Expected Output:** 4  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification:** The altitude changes are \\([4, 1, 3, 2, 0]\\), where 4 is the highest altitude reached.\n",

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll track the cumulative altitude as we traverse the array of altitude changes. We start with an initial altitude of zero. As we iterate through the array, we continually update the current altitude by adding the current change (which could be positive, negative, or zero) to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously, we keep track of the highest altitude reached so far. This can be done by comparing the current altitude with the maximum altitude recorded after each update. Once we have gone through all the changes, the recorded maximum altitude is the answer. This approach efficiently calculates the highest altitude with a single pass through the array, ensuring optimal time complexity.\n",

    "Here is the solution with detailed steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialize Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by initializing two variables: `currentAltitude` and `maxAltitude`.\n",
    "Set both `currentAltitude` and `maxAltitude` to 0, as the starting point is considered at sea level (zero altitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterate Through the Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through each element of the given array of altitude changes.\n",
    "For each element in the array, consider it as a change in altitude (gain or loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update Current Altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "During each iteration, add the current element (altitude change) to `currentAltitude`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check and Update Maximum Altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "After updating `currentAltitude`, compare it with `maxAltitude`.\n",
    "If `currentAltitude` is greater than `maxAltitude`, update `maxAltitude` with the value of `currentAltitude`.\n",
    "This ensures that `maxAltitude` always holds the highest altitude reached so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continue Until the End of the Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue the process of updating `currentAltitude` and checking/updating `maxAltitude` until you reach the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return the Highest Altitude\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the iteration through the entire array, `maxAltitude` will hold the highest altitude reached during the journey.\n",
    "Return `maxAltitude` as the final result.\n",
    "\n",
