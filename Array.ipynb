    "Initially, the first element of the output array is the same as the input array since there are no preceding elements to add.

This is because the previous element in the output array already contains the cumulative sum of all the previous elements in the input array.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5.\tContinue Until the End of the Array: Continue steps 3 and 4 for each element in the array. By the end of the loop, each array element will have been replaced with the cumulative sum up to that point.\n",

Thus, it is computationally efficient while also being memory-efficient, as we don't store intermediate results in additional data structures.\n"
