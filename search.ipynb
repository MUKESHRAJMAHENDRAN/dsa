    "## Searching\n",
    "Searching algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science used to locate specific items within a collection of data. Here’s a brief introduction to linear and binary search, along with their real-world use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Search:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Linear search is a straightforward search algorithm that checks every element in a list sequentially until the target element is found or all elements have been checked.\n",
    "   - **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "     - **Unordered Lists:** When items are stored in an unordered manner, such as an unsorted array or a list of names, linear search is commonly used to find a specific item.\n",
    "     - **Simple Databases:** In basic database operations, linear search can be used to find records based on a non-indexed field (like a sequential scan).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Binary Search:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Binary search is an efficient search algorithm used for finding an element within a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.\n",
    "   - **Real-World Use Case:**\n",
    "     - **Sorted Lists:** Binary search shines when the data is already sorted, as it drastically reduces the number of elements that need to be checked compared to linear search.\n",
    "     - **Searching in Dictionaries:** In language dictionaries or glossaries (both physical and digital), binary search can quickly locate a word based on its alphabetical position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison:**\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Binary search is significantly faster for large datasets compared to linear search because its time complexity is \\( O(\\log n) \\) compared to \\( O(n) \\) for linear search.\n",
    "- **Preconditions:** Binary search requires the data to be sorted beforehand, whereas linear search does not impose any ordering requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while linear search is simpler and works well for small datasets or when data is unordered, binary search offers a more efficient solution for finding items in large, sorted datasets, making it preferable for many real-world applications where performance matters."

    "\n",
    "Binary search is a highly efficient searching algorithm used for finding the position of an element in a sorted array. Unlike linear search, which scans each element in the array sequentially, binary search divides the search interval in half repeatedly, making the search process significantly faster, especially for large datasets. This method requires the array to be sorted before the search begins because the core mechanism of the algorithm relies on the ability to discard half of the elements in each step based on a single comparison.\n",

    "   - **Check match:** If the middle element is equal to the target, return the middle index.\n",

    "4. **Conclusion:**\n",
    "   - If the search completes without finding the target (when `left` exceeds `right`), return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of binary search is its decision-based approach to narrowing down the possible location of the sought element. If the target element is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array; otherwise, it continues in the lower half. This process continues until the target element is found or the search interval is exhausted.\n",

    "## Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array `nums` sorted in increasing order, return the maximum between the count of positive integers and the count of negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: 0 is neither positive nor negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "- **Input:** `nums = [-4, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `4`\n",
    "- **Justification:** The array contains three negative integers (-4, -3, -1) and four positive integers (1, 3, 5, 7). The maximum count between negatives and positives is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "- **Input:** `nums = [-8, -7, -5, -4, 0, 0, 0]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `4`\n",
    "- **Justification:** Here, there are four negative integers (-8, -7, -5, -4) and no positives. Thus, the maximum count is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "- **Input:** `nums = [0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `6`\n",
    "- **Justification:** This input array includes zero negative integers and six positives (2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4). Hence, the maximum count is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`\n",
    "- `-2000 <= nums[i] <= 2000`\n",
    "- `nums` is sorted in a non-decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, the primary approach involves efficiently counting the positive and negative numbers in the sorted array. Given the array is already sorted, we can leverage this property by using binary search to quickly determine the boundary between negative and positive integers, optimizing the count operation. This boundary identification will allow for rapid determination of the counts of negative and positive integers without having to iterate through every element, thus promising a time-efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sorted nature of the array ensures that once we find the first positive integer, all subsequent integers are positive, allowing this method to be particularly effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-step Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    - Declare and initialize `start` to 0 and `end` to `nums.length - 1`.\n",
    "    - Initialize `maxNegatives` and `maxPositives` to 0 to store the maximum counts of negative and positive numbers respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **First Pass: Counting Negative Numbers:**\n",
    "    - While `start` is less than or equal to `end`:\n",
    "        - Compute the midpoint `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.\n",
    "        - If `nums[mid] < 0`, it indicates that we still have negative numbers:\n",
    "            - Update `maxNegatives` to `mid + 1` since this counts how many elements are negative (indices from 0 to mid).\n",
    "            - Set `start` to `mid + 1` to continue searching to the right of `mid`.\n",
    "        - Else, adjust `end` to `mid - 1` to search in the left half for more negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Second Pass: Counting Positive Numbers:**\n",
    "    - Reset `start` to 0 and `end` to `nums.length - 1`.\n",
    "    - While `start` is less than or equal to `end`:\n",
    "        - Compute the midpoint `mid = start + (end - start) / 2`.\n",
    "        - If `nums[mid] > 0`, it indicates that we are in the range of positive numbers:\n",
    "            - Update `maxPositives` to `nums.length - mid` to count all positive numbers from `mid` to the end of the array.\n",
    "            - Set `end` to `mid - 1` to continue searching to the left of `mid` for the start of positive numbers.\n",
    "        - Else, adjust `start` to `mid + 1` to search in the right half for the first positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Maximum Count:**\n",
    "    - Use the `Math.max` function to determine and return the maximum of `maxNegatives` and `maxPositives`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "Let's consider the input: `nums = [-4, -3, -1, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting Negative Numbers:**\n",
    "    - Start with `start = 0`, `end = 7`.\n",
    "    - Iteration 1: `mid = 3`, value at `mid` is 0. Adjust `end` to 2.\n",
    "    - Iteration 2: `mid = 1`, value at `mid` is -3. It is negative, so update `maxNegatives` to 2 and move `start` to 2.\n",

    "   - If the loop completes without finding any common element, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Binary Search Method:**\n",
    "   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the search boundaries.\n",
    "   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:\n",
    "     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.\n",

    "     - Adjust the `left` or `right` pointers based on the comparison result to narrow the search.\n",
    "     - If the target is not found by the end of the loop, return `False`.\n",

    "### Intuition and Code Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the algorithm is to find the maximum frequency of any number in an array after performing at most `k` increments on the array elements. The solution leverages a sliding window approach to achieve this efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we can more easily calculate the number of increments needed to make a range of elements equal to a particular target value. The target value in each iteration is the current element pointed to by the right pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window to maintain a range of elements. The window is expanded by moving the right pointer and may be contracted by moving the left pointer based on whether the window is valid or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Window Validity**: A window is considered valid if the number of increments required to make all elements in the window equal to the target (element at the right pointer) does not exceed `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if the current window is valid, we use the formula:\n",
    "\\[ (right - left + 1) \\times \\text{target} - \\text{curr} \\leq k \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( (right - left + 1) \\): Number of elements in the current window.\n",
    "- \\(\\text{target}\\): The value at `nums[right]`.\n",
    "- \\(\\text{curr}\\): The sum of elements in the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above condition holds, the window is valid. Otherwise, we need to shrink the window by moving the left pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation with Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example `nums = [1, 2, 4]` and `k = 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "   - Sort `nums`: `[1, 2, 4]` (already sorted).\n",
    "   - Initialize `left = 0` and `curr = 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate with `right` Pointer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### First Iteration (`right = 0`):\n",
    "   - `target = nums[right] = 1`\n",
    "   - `curr += target = 0 + 1 = 1`\n",
    "   - Check the condition: `(right - left + 1) * target - curr > k`\n",
    "     - `(0 - 0 + 1) * 1 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`\n",
    "     - `0 <= 5` (Condition is false, so we don't adjust `left`)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Current window: `[1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Second Iteration (`right = 1`):\n",
    "   - `target = nums[right] = 2`\n",
    "   - `curr += target = 1 + 2 = 3`\n",
    "   - Check the condition: `(right - left + 1) * target - curr > k`\n",
    "     - `(1 - 0 + 1) * 2 - 3 = 2 * 2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1`\n",
    "     - `1 <= 5` (Condition is false, so we don't adjust `left`)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Current window: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Third Iteration (`right = 2`):\n",
    "   - `target = nums[right] = 4`\n",
    "   - `curr += target = 3 + 4 = 7`\n",
    "   - Check the condition: `(right - left + 1) * target - curr > k`\n",
    "     - `(2 - 0 + 1) * 4 - 7 = 3 * 4 - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5`\n",
    "     - `5 <= 5` (Condition is false, so we don't adjust `left`)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Current window: `[1, 2, 4]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Calculation**:\n",
    "   - The window is valid and contains 3 elements.\n",
    "   - `len(nums) - left = 3 - 0 = 3`\n",
    "   - Return `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm effectively finds the maximum frequency of any number after performing at most `k` increments on the array elements. The sliding window approach ensures that the solution is efficient by maintaining and adjusting a valid window of elements that can be made equal within the allowed increments."

    "1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Function**:\n",
    "    - The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a helper function for calculating the least common multiple (LCM).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimize Set Function**:\n",
    "    - **Initialization**:\n",
    "        - `left` is set to the sum of `uniqueCnt1` and `uniqueCnt2`, which is the minimum possible size of the set that can contain at least `uniqueCnt1` unique numbers not divisible by `divisor1` and `uniqueCnt2` unique numbers not divisible by `divisor2`.\n",
    "        - `right` is set to a very large value, initially set to `divisor1 * divisor2 * uniqueCnt1 * uniqueCnt2`.\n",
    "        - `lcm` is calculated as the least common multiple of `divisor1` and `divisor2` using the formula `lcm = (divisor1 * divisor2) // gcd(divisor1, divisor2)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Binary Search**:\n",
    "        - A binary search is conducted to find the minimum number that satisfies the conditions.\n",
    "        - In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the middle of the current search range.\n",
    "        - `countBoth` is the number of elements up to `mid` that are divisible by both `divisor1` and `divisor2`.\n",
    "        - The conditions checked are:\n",
    "            1. `mid - countBoth >= uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2`: Ensures there are enough numbers not divisible by both divisors.\n",
    "            2. `mid - (mid // divisor1) >= uniqueCnt1`: Ensures there are enough numbers not divisible by `divisor1`.\n",
    "            3. `mid - (mid // divisor2) >= uniqueCnt2`: Ensures there are enough numbers not divisible by `divisor2`.\n",
    "        - If these conditions are met, `right` is adjusted to search for a smaller valid number.\n",
    "        - If not, `left` is adjusted to search for a larger number.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Return**:\n",
    "        - The function returns `left`, which is the smallest number that satisfies the conditions after the binary search completes."
