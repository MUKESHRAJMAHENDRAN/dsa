    "- **ListNode class**: Represents nodes in a singly linked list.\n",
    "- **reverseKGroup function**: Main function that reverses nodes in groups of size k.\n",
    "  - **reverseLinkedList function**: Helper function to reverse a linked list of size k.\n",
    "  - **Counting nodes**: Counts the total number of nodes in the linked list.\n",
    "  - **Dummy node**: Introduced to handle cases where the head itself needs to be modified.\n",
    "  - **Reversing groups**: Iterates through the list, reverses each group of size k, and adjusts pointers accordingly.\n",
    "  - **Edge handling**: Ensures that any remaining nodes (less than k) are left unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently handles the problem requirements, ensuring the linked list is modified in place while managing edge cases such as incomplete groups of nodes."

    "Let's walk through the step-by-step execution of the `reverseKGroup` function using the example provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- Linked list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "- k = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:**\n",
    "1. **Dummy Node Setup:**\n",
    "   - Create a dummy node (`dummy`) that points to the head of the list.\n",
    "   - `dummy.next` initially points to the head of the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pointers Setup:**\n",
    "   - `prev` is initialized to `dummy`, which helps in managing the connection between reversed and unreversed parts of the list.\n",
    "   - Calculate the length of the list, which is 5 in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Cut the Group to Be Reversed:**\n",
