    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm aims to traverse each customer's accounts, compute their total wealth by summing up the balances, and track the wealthiest customer found so far. We utilize a straightforward iterative method, whereby we loop through each customer and their respective accounts, calculating the sum of each customer's accounts, and then making a comparison against a stored maximum wealth variable. If the current customer's total wealth surpasses our stored maximum, we update our stored value. Upon completion of the iteration through all customers, our stored maximum wealth value represents the wealth of the richest customer. Simplicity and a single-pass solution make this algorithm appealing, ensuring computational efficiency by avoiding nested loops and minimizing computational steps where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a variable `maxWealth` to store and track the maximum wealth found during the iteration. Set its initial value to 0 as we will use it for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through the 2D-array of accounts using a loop. Each sub-array represents one customer's accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each customer, calculate their total wealth by summing up all the values in their respective sub-array. Utilize another loop or a `sum` function for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the computed sum of the current customer with `maxWealth`. If it’s greater, update `maxWealth` with the new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all customers in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once the iteration is complete, `maxWealth` holds the maximum wealth among all customers. Return this value as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s illustrate the algorithm using a simple example with an input array `[[5,10,15],[10,20,30],[15,30,45]]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize `maxWealth` to 0: This will store the maximum wealth we find as we traverse through the accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "`maxWealth = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterating through the customer arrays:\n",
    "  - First customer: `[5,10,15]`\n",
    "    - Calculate total wealth: 5 + 10 + 15 = 30\n",
    "    - Compare and update `maxWealth`: `maxWealth` (0) < 30 => Update `maxWealth` to 30\n",
    "  - Second customer: `[10,20,30]`\n",
    "    - Calculate total wealth: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60\n",
    "    - Compare and update `maxWealth`: `maxWealth` (30) < 60 => Update `maxWealth` to 60\n",
    "  - Third customer: `[15,30,45]`\n",
    "    - Calculate total wealth: 15 + 30 + 45 = 90\n",
    "    - Compare and update `maxWealth`: `maxWealth` (60) < 90 => Update `maxWealth` to 90\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The final value of `maxWealth` is 90, which represents the richest customer's wealth. So, 90 is returned as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach guarantees we evaluate the total wealth of each customer and always maintain the wealthiest customer's wealth encountered thus far in our `maxWealth` variable, ensuring we find the correct answer by the end of our iterations."

This approach is effective in that it avoids unnecessary calculations or traversals through the matrix, adhering strictly to the diagonal indices to retrieve the values to be summed. The main mechanism involves identifying and summing the elements of the primary and secondary diagonal, ensuring that, if the matrix size is odd, the central element (which belongs to both diagonals) is not double-counted.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Sum**: Start by initializing a variable to store the sum of the diagonal elements. Let's call this variable `diagonalSum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Through Matrix**: Iterate through the matrix using a loop. Since the matrix is square, you can use a single index to traverse both rows and columns. Let's use `i` as the loop variable, ranging from 0 to the length of the matrix minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add Primary Diagonal Elements**: In each iteration, add the element at the primary diagonal to `diagonalSum`. The primary diagonal elements are those where the row and column indices are equal, i.e., `matrix[i][i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Secondary Diagonal Elements**: In the same iteration, add the element at the secondary diagonal to `diagonalSum`. The secondary diagonal elements are those where the column index is the complement of the row index, i.e., `matrix[i][matrix.length - 1 - i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid Double Counting**: If the matrix has an odd number of rows and columns, the central element will be counted twice (once for each diagonal). To correct this, subtract the central element from `diagonalSum`. The central element is at the position `matrix[middle][middle]`, where `middle = matrix.length / 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return the Result**: After completing the loop, return the value of `diagonalSum`. This is the sum of the elements on both diagonals of the matrix.\n",
