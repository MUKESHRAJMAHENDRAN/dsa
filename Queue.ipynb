    "**What is a Queue?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're at your favorite coffee shop. It's rush hour, and there's a line of people waiting to place their orders. This line is a perfect real-life example of a Queue! In this line, the person who has been waiting the longest gets served first (we call this the \"First In, First Out\" or FIFO principle). Just like this, a Queue in computer science is a type of data structure where the element that enters first is the one that gets accessed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why should you care about Queues? Well, Queues are an essential data structure in computer science. They help us solve complex problems and are widely used in various fields, from handling processes in an operating system to managing data packets in networking. By the end of this chapter, you'll see just how valuable understanding Queues can be!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Where Do We See Queues?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our daily lives, we encounter Queues in various scenarios. Let's take a closer look at some of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traffic Management:** Queues are used in network devices to control the amount of data traffic. The data packets are held in a Queue and processed in a FIFO manner, maintaining order and ensuring fair access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Centers:** In a customer service line or a call center, incoming calls are placed in a Queue, and agents attend to them in the order they came in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operating Systems:** Queues play a vital role in managing processes in operating systems. They are used in task scheduling, where processes are kept in a Queue and allocated to the CPU based on scheduling algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Printers:** Printer tasks are managed using Queues. Print jobs are added to the Queue and are executed in the order of their arrival.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queues in Programming**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of programming and data structures, Queues are used in a variety of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Queues are used in the BFS algorithm to visit nodes of a tree or a graph in a breadth-wise manner (we will discuss this in detail later). It starts at a given node (often the root of a tree or any node of a graph), then explores all of the neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Caching:** Certain caching strategies, like 'First-In-First-Out' (FIFO) caching, make use of Queues. The oldest item is removed when the cache is full and a new item is to be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Data Transfer:** Queues are used in scenarios where data is transferred asynchronously (data is not necessarily received at the same rate it's sent) between two processes. For example, in I/O Buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Concepts - Priority Queues and Queueing Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Priority Queues - Because Order Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Priority Queue or Heap (discussed later in the course) is a special type of Queue in which each element is associated with a priority. Elements are served based on their priority - not based on their position in the Queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest-priority elements are dequeued first. If elements with equal priorities are dequeued, they are served according to their order in the Queue. Priority Queues are commonly used in operating systems for process scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Queueing Theory - Behind The Scenes of Queues**\n",
    "\n",
    "Queueing Theory is a mathematical study of waiting lines, or Queues. It's used to predict queue lengths and wait times. It's a key component of operations research and performance engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queueing Theory helps in understanding and managing Queues better in various fields, from telecommunications to traffic engineering. It forms the backbone of efficient resource allocation and is a must-know for anyone diving deep into Queues.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Input: Push operations: [1, 2, 3], Pop operations: 2\n",
    "  Output: [1]\n",

    "\n",
    "**Solution Explanation in Paragraph Format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a stack using two queues, we use the principle of reversing the order of elements. When a new element is pushed onto the stack, it needs to be positioned such that it can be accessed first, adhering to the stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) nature. This is achieved by using two queues, named main and auxiliary queues. Each new element is first added to the auxiliary queue. Then, all elements from the main queue (which holds the stack elements) are dequeued and enqueued into the auxiliary queue. This process effectively places the newest element at the front of the queue. Finally, the two queues are swapped, making the auxiliary queue the new main queue and vice versa. The pop operation is straightforward, involving simply dequeuing an element from the main queue, which is now at the front due to the previous rearrangements.\n",

    "1. **Initialize Two Queues:** Create two queues (main and aux) to manage the stack elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Push Operation:**\n",
    "   - Add the new element to the aux queue.\n",
    "   - Move all elements from the main queue to the aux queue, thereby placing the new element at the front of the combined queue.\n",
    "   - Swap the roles of main and aux queues, making the auxiliary queue the new main queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pop Operation:**\n",
    "   - Remove and return the front element from the main queue, which is effectively the top of the stack."

    "The approach to solve this problem involves utilizing a deque (double-ended queue) to efficiently track the maximum elements in each window of size `k` as we traverse the array. Initially, we populate the deque with indices of elements, ensuring that it always contains elements in decreasing order. This way, the front of the deque always holds the index of the current maximum element. As we move the window, we add new elements to the rear of the deque, removing those from the front that fall outside the current window. We also remove elements from the rear if they are smaller than the new element being added, as they are no longer potential maximums. This strategy ensures that for each window, we can quickly identify the maximum element, which is always at the front of the deque.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a Deque:**\n",
    "   - Create an empty deque (double-ended queue) that will be used to store the indices of array elements. This deque will help us maintain the potential maximum elements for each subarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process the First 'k' Elements:**\n",
    "   - Iterate through the first 'k' elements of the array.\n",
    "   - For each element, while the deque is not empty and the last element in the deque is less than or equal to the current element, remove the last element from the deque. This step ensures that the deque contains elements in decreasing order.\n",
    "   - Add the current element's index to the rear of the deque.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process the Remaining Elements of the Array:**\n",
    "   - For each element in the array starting from the 'k'th element:\n",
    "     - Add the element at the front of the deque to the result, as it represents the maximum of the previous subarray.\n",
    "     - Remove the indices from the front of the deque if they are out of the current window (i.e., if the index is less than the current index - 'k').\n",
    "     - Similar to step 2, remove elements from the rear of the deque if they are smaller than or equal to the current element, as they cannot be the maximum for the current or future windows.\n",
    "     - Add the current element's index to the rear of the deque.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Result:**\n",
    "   - The result contains the maximum of each subarray of size 'k'."
