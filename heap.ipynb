    "### Introduction to Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are a specialized data structure and are based on binary trees. They are of the following two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **max heap**, every parent node has a value bigger than or equal to its children.\n",
    "- In a **min heap**, every parent node has a value smaller than or equal to its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An Example of MaxHeap.](images/max_heap.svg)\n",
    "*An Example of MaxHeap.*\n",
    "\n",
    "![An Example of MinHeap.](images/min_heap.svg)\n",
    "*An Example of MinHeap.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This ordering property allows heaps to efficiently support operations like finding the maximum or minimum element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key characteristics of heaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heaps are commonly implemented as binary heaps, which are binary trees represented using arrays.\n",
    "- The time required for insertion and deletion is O(log n). Max/Min can be found in O(1).\n",
    "- Heaps allow efficient implementation of priority queues, removing elements based on priority instead of insertion order.\n",
    "- The heapify operation efficiently converts an array into a heap in O(n) time.\n",
    "- Heaps are employed in heap sorting by continually extracting components in the correct sequence, which takes O(n log n) time.\n",
    "- Applications include graph algorithms like Dijkstra's, scheduling algorithms, and sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, heaps are tree structures that enable quick access to the minimum or maximum value and allow priority-based ordering. Their speed and flexibility make them useful data structures for many algorithms. One of the ways to implement heaps is by implementing them as binary heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary heaps are a common implementation of heaps as binary trees. They have the following key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure of Heap**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completeness:** All levels of the tree are completely filled, except the last level, filled from left to right.\n",
    "- **Shape:** The binary tree must have the correct shape and be a full binary tree, with the last level having the fewest nodes of all the levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heap order property:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max heap:** The key of a node is greater than or equal to the keys of its descendants.\n",
    "- **Min heap:** The key of a node is less than or equal to the keys of its descendants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary heaps can effectively enable determining the minimum or maximum thanks to this order property, which can be done in O(1) time by examining the root node. The structure of a heap is a quality that combines completeness and shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to maintain the heap ordering property to ensure the proper functioning of insertion and deletion operations. To keep the heap invariant, newly added elements should either \"bubble up\" or \"bubble down.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "You're presented with several piles of gifts, with each pile containing a certain number of gifts. Every second, you'll engage in the following activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick the pile that contains the highest number of gifts. If multiple piles share this distinction, you can select any of them.\n",
    "2. Compute the square root of the number of gifts in the selected pile, and then leave behind that many gifts (rounded down). Take all the other gifts from this pile.\n",

    "- 1 <= k <= 10^3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem, we leverage a max heap data structure. A max heap allows us to efficiently retrieve and process the pile with the most gifts at any given time. Once we choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts, we compute the number of gifts we'd leave behind (which is the floor value of the square root of the gifts in that pile) and then push this new value back into the max heap. This operation is repeated 'k' times. After these 'k' operations, we sum up the remaining gifts in all the piles to get our final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heap Initialization:** We start by creating a max heap. However, some programming languages, like Python, provide a min heap by default. To turn this into a max heap, we can insert negative values. By doing so, retrieving the smallest element from this heap effectively gives us the pile with the most gifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing 'k' Operations:** For each of the 'k' operations, we:\n",
    "   - Pop the heap to get the pile with the most gifts.\n",
    "   - Calculate the gifts we'll take by subtracting the floor value of the square root of the current pile size.\n",
    "   - Push the remaining gifts back into the max heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating Remaining Gifts:** After the 'k' operations are completed, we simply sum up all the elements present in our heap. This total represents the number of gifts left across all piles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Returning the Result:** Finally, the accumulated result is returned as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm efficiently processes the piles and allows us to always operate on the pile with the most gifts, ensuring that the gifts are taken in the most optimal manner as per the problem's requirements. The use of a max heap provides a clear way to consistently choose the correct pile to operate on without having to sort or iterate through the entire array in each of the 'k' operations.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **Input:** \"apple\"\n",
    "  - **Expected Output:** \"ppale\" or \"ppela\"\n",

    "- **Input:** \"banana\"\n",
    "  - **Expected Output:** \"aaannb\".\n",
    "  - **Justification:** The character 'a' appears three times, 'n' twice, and 'b' once.\n",
    "- **Input:** \"aabb\"\n",
    "  - **Expected Output:** \"aabb\" or \"bbaa\"\n",
    "  - **Justification:** Both 'a' and 'b' appear twice, so they can appear in any order in the output.\n",

    "- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5\n",
    "- s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters and digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "The solution involves three key steps. First, count the frequency of each character in the string. This can be done using a hashmap where keys are characters and values are their respective counts. Second, build a max heap (priority queue) where each element is a character, and the heap is sorted based on the frequency of characters. The character with the highest frequency will be at the top. Lastly, construct the result string by repeatedly removing the top element of the heap (the most frequent character) and appending it to the result string until the heap is empty. This process ensures that characters are added to the result string in descending order of their frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Breakdown:**\n",
    "1. **Building a Frequency Map:** Begin by iterating over the characters in the string. As you traverse, construct a frequency map (or dictionary) that associates each character with its occurrence count.\n",
    "2. **Constructing a Max Heap:** Next, utilize the frequency map to build a max heap. Each item in this heap will be a character-frequency pair, but the heap will be organized based on the frequencies. This ensures that characters with higher frequencies will reside at the top of the heap.\n",
    "3. **Building the Result String:** Start an iterative process where you repeatedly pop the heap to get the character with the highest current frequency. Each time you pop, append the character to the result string as many times as its frequency indicates. This ensures that characters with higher frequencies are placed before those with lower frequencies in the result.\n",
    "4. **Completion:** Once the heap is exhausted, your result string is complete, containing characters sorted by their frequencies in descending order. This string is then returned as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utilization of a max heap is crucial here, as it allows efficient retrieval of the character with the highest frequency at any given point in the process, ensuring the desired order in the result string.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Begin by inserting all the stick lengths into a min-heap. This structure ensures that the smallest stick lengths are always easily accessible at the top.\n",

    "   - Remove the two smallest stick lengths from the heap (these are the two at the top).\n",
    "   - Combine these two sticks, which results in a new stick whose length is the sum of the two original ones. Add this combination cost to a running total.\n",
    "   - Insert the new combined stick length back into the heap. This is done to consider this stick for future combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Final Stick:** After all combinations are complete, we'll be left with just one stick in the heap, which represents the combined length of all original sticks. The running total we kept during the combination steps represents the minimum cost to connect the sticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return:** Lastly, the accumulated cost is returned as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this approach is optimal is that, at each step, we're combining the smallest possible sticks, ensuring that larger sticks (which have a higher combination cost) are combined fewer times.\n",

    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a class to calculate the median of a number stream. The class should have the following two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `insertNum(int num)`: stores the number in the class.\n",
    "- `findMedian()`: returns the median of all numbers inserted in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the count of numbers inserted in the class is even, the median will be the average of the middle two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `insertNum(3)`\n",
    "2. `insertNum(1)`\n",
    "3. `findMedian()` -> output: `2`\n",
    "4. `insertNum(5)`\n",
    "5. `findMedian()` -> output: `3`\n",
    "6. `insertNum(4)`\n",
    "7. `findMedian()` -> output: `3.5`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "-105 <= num <= 105\n",
    "There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.\n",
    "At most 5 * 104 calls will be made to insertNum and findMedian.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, the median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. So a brute force solution could be to maintain a sorted list of all numbers inserted in the class so that we can efficiently return the median whenever required. Inserting a number in a sorted list will take O(N) time if there are ‘N’ numbers in the list. This insertion will be similar to the Insertion sort. Can we do better than this? Can we utilize the fact that we don’t need the fully sorted list - we are only interested in finding the middle element?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume ‘x’ is the median of a list. This means that half of the numbers in the list will be smaller than (or equal to) ‘x’ and half will be greater than (or equal to) ‘x’. This leads us to an approach where we can divide the list into two halves: one half to store all the smaller numbers (let’s call it smallNumList) and one half to store the larger numbers (let’s call it largeNumList). The median of all the numbers will either be the largest number in the smallNumList or the smallest number in the largeNumList. If the total number of elements is even, the median will be the average of these two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best data structure that comes to mind to find the smallest or largest number among a list of numbers is a Heap. Let’s see how we can use a heap to find a better algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can store the first half of numbers (i.e., smallNumList) in a Max Heap. We should use a Max Heap as we are interested in knowing the largest number in the first half.\n",
    "- We can store the second half of numbers (i.e., largeNumList) in a Min Heap, as we are interested in knowing the smallest number in the second half. Inserting a number in a heap will take O(logN), which is better than the brute force approach. At any time, the median of the current list of numbers can be calculated from the top element of the two heaps."

    "Sure, let's walk through the algorithm step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: \n",
    "   - Create two heaps:\n",
    "     - Max Heap (smallNumList): This will store the first half of the numbers, containing the smaller numbers.\n",
    "     - Min Heap (largeNumList): This will store the second half of the numbers, containing the larger numbers.\n",
    "   - Initially, both heaps are empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insertion (insertNum)**:\n",
    "   - Compare the new number (`num`) with the current median.\n",
    "   - If `num` is less than or equal to the current median, insert it into the Max Heap (`smallNumList`).\n",
    "   - If `num` is greater than the current median, insert it into the Min Heap (`largeNumList`).\n",
    "   - After insertion, balance the heaps:\n",
    "     - If the sizes of both heaps differ by more than 1, rebalance them by moving the root element from the larger heap to the smaller heap.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Finding Median (findMedian)**:\n",
    "   - Check the sizes of the heaps:\n",
    "     - If both heaps have the same size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.\n",
    "     - If one heap has more elements than the other, the median is the root of the heap with more elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Insertion: O(logN), where N is the total number of elements inserted.\n",
    "   - Finding Median: O(1), as it involves accessing the root elements of the heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we insert the numbers `[3, 1, 5, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After inserting `3`, `smallNumList` = `[3]` (Max Heap), `largeNumList` = `[]` (Min Heap), median = `3`.\n",
    "- After inserting `1`, `smallNumList` = `[1]` (Max Heap), `largeNumList` = `[3]` (Min Heap), median = `(1 + 3) / 2 = 2`.\n",
    "- After inserting `5`, `smallNumList` = `[1]` (Max Heap), `largeNumList` = `[3, 5]` (Min Heap), median = `3`.\n",
    "- After inserting `4`, `smallNumList` = `[1, 3]` (Max Heap), `largeNumList` = `[4, 5]` (Min Heap), median = `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm ensures that we maintain balanced heaps, allowing us to efficiently find the median at any point."
