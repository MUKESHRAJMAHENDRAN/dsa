    "# Introduction to HashSets\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a HashSet is a collection or a group of unique elements. Think of it as a party where everyone has a different name; no two people can have the same name. In coding terms, this means HashSets do not allow duplicate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Difference at a Glance: HashTable vs. HashSet\n",
    "\n",
    "HashTable is like a dictionary, full of word (key) and definition (value) pairs. In contrast, HashSet is more like a unique-word collector, not bothered about definitions, just the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Characteristics of HashSets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: The first thing to remember about HashSets is that every element is unique. It’s like having a basket of fruits, and no two fruits in it are the same. This uniqueness is the superpower of HashSets!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Elements**: A HashSet can include a null element. It’s like having an empty slot in your fruit basket, and that’s perfectly okay!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order**: When it comes to order, HashSets like to keep it casual. They do not guarantee any specific order of the elements. It’s like reaching into your fruit basket blindfolded – you never know which fruit you’ll grab first!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Working of a HashSet\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Duplicates**: So, what happens when HashSets encounter a duplicate? They simply ignore it! If you try to add a fruit that’s already in your basket, HashSet will just keep the original and discard the duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashing Function**: HashSets, like HashTables, use a hashing function to decide where each element should go. It’s like assigning a specific spot in your basket for each fruit based on its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resizing the Set**: What happens when your basket gets full? When a HashSet starts running out of room, they increase the basket size to make space for more unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will solve some problems related to HashSets."

    "To solve this problem, the first step is to add all elements of the given array into a HashSet. This allows for constant time complexity (O(1)) checks for the presence of any number. After populating the HashSet, iterate through the array once more. During this iteration, for each element, check if its direct successor (the element itself plus one) is present in the HashSet. If the successor is found, increment a counter. This counter will keep track of the total number of elements that have their direct successors within the array. The final value of this counter, after completing the iteration over the array, will be the solution to this problem.\n",

If it is, it means this stone is also a jewel. We keep a count of such stones. The final count gives us the total number of stones that are also jewels. The efficiency of this solution lies in the HashSet's ability to quickly check for the presence of a jewel, making the overall process highly efficient for large strings.\n",

    "After we have the frequencies, the second step is to ensure the uniqueness of these frequencies. We achieve this by storing each frequency in a hashset.

    "Input: \"abrkaabcdefghijjxxx\"  \n",
    "Expected Output: 10  \n",
    "Justification: The longest segment with distinct characters is \"abcdefghij\", which has a length of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4\n",
    "- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, iterate through the characters of the given string while maintaining a HashSet to track the characters already encountered. As we traverse the string, each character is checked against the HashSet. If the character is not present in the HashSet, it indicates no repetition, and we add it to the HashSet and continue. However, if a character is already in the HashSet, it means a repetition has occurred. At this point, we update the length of the longest substring found so far (if necessary), and modify the HashSet to remove the characters up to and including the repeated character. This process continues until we have traversed the entire string. The final result is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization: \n",
    "Begin with two pointers, start and end, both at the start of the string. The hashset will initially be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sliding Window Expansion:\n",
    "Progressively move the end pointer to the right until you come across a character that's already in the hashset, indicating a repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusting Start Pointer: \n",
    "Upon detecting a repeated character, increment the start pointer by one position and remove the character at the start position from the hashset. This action ensures that the window only contains unique characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result Calculation: \n",
    "At each step, calculate the length of the current window (from start to end). Keep track of the maximum length observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this process, the maximum length observed will be the length of the longest segment of unique characters in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the string \"abrkaabcdefghijjxxx\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize start and end to 0, and an empty hashset.\n",
    "- As you move end from 0 to the end of the string:\n",
    "  - When end is at position 4 (character 'a'), since 'a' is already in the hashset, we will remove the character at position 0 ('a') from the hashset and move start to position 1.\n",
    "  - Continue this process, always ensuring the characters between start and end are unique.\n",
    "  - Calculate the length of the segment at each step (start -> end) and update the maximum length.\n",
    "- The maximum length observed will be 10, corresponding to the segment \"abcdefghij\".\n",
