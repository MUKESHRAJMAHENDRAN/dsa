    "### Greedy Algorithm Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "A greedy algorithm is a simple approach to solving optimization problems. It works by making the best possible choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. However, unlike dynamic programming, it doesn't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Greedy Algorithm Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty solution.\n",
    "2. **Greedy Choice:** At each step, pick the best available option without considering future consequences.\n",
    "3. **Feasibility Check:** Ensure that the chosen option does not violate any constraints.\n",
    "4. **Termination:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until a complete solution is found or the problem is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD;\n",
    "    A[Start] --> B[Pick Best Option];\n",
    "    B --> C[Check Feasibility];\n",
    "    C --> D[Is Complete?];\n",
    "    D -->|Yes| E[Solution Found];\n",
    "    D -->|No| B;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Minimum Coin Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the problem of finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change. \n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD;\n",
    "    A[Start] --> B[Initialize];\n",
    "    B --> C[Choose Best Coin];\n",
    "    C --> D[Check Feasibility];\n",
    "    D --> E[Is Complete?];\n",
    "    E -->|Yes| F[Solution Found];\n",
    "    E -->|No| C;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, at each step, we choose the largest coin that does not exceed the remaining amount. We repeat this process until the remaining amount becomes zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros and Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Simple and easy to implement.\n",
    "- Efficient for certain problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Doesn't guarantee an optimal solution.\n",
    "- May get stuck in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy algorithms are a powerful tool in solving optimization problems, but they require careful consideration of the problem's constraints and characteristics to ensure a satisfactory solution."

    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given string `s`, determine whether it's possible to make a given string palindrome by removing at most one character.\n",
    "\n",
    "A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `\"racecar\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output: `true`\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: The string is already a palindrome, so no removals are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `\"abeccdeba\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output: `true`\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: Removing the character `'d'` forms the palindrome `\"abccba\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `\"abcdef\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output: `false`\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: No single character removal will make this string a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= `s.length` <= 10^5\n",
    "- `str` consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use a two-pointer approach that initiates at both ends of the string. These pointers move towards the center, comparing characters at each step. Upon encountering a mismatch, the algorithm decides whether to skip the character at the left or the right pointer. A helper function is used to check if the resulting substring (after skipping a character) forms a palindrome. This process is performed twice, once for each pointer. If either scenario results in a palindrome, the original string can be considered a valid palindrome after removing at most one character. This efficient method determines the feasibility of forming a palindrome with minimal alterations to the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** Begin by initializing the left pointer with `0` and the right pointer with `n - 1`, where `n` is a string length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-Pointer Traversal:** Use two pointers, and move these pointers towards the center, comparing the characters at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Mismatch:** Upon encountering a mismatch, the algorithm checks two scenarios: removing the character at the left pointer or at the right pointer. For each scenario, it checks if the remaining substring forms a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy Decision Making:** If either resulting substring is a palindrome, return `true`. This decision is based on the greedy principle that choosing the first viable option (resulting in a palindrome) is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concluding Result:** If neither scenario results in a palindrome, the algorithm concludes that it's impossible to form a palindrome by removing just one character and returns `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This greedy approach is efficient as it minimizes the number of checks needed to determine if the string can be a valid palindrome with a single character removal.\n",

    "The greedy approach to solving the problem involves initially sorting the pairs based on their second elements. This step is crucial as it aligns the pairs in a way that the one with the smallest end is considered first, leading to more opportunities for chain extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting, we iterate through the pairs, maintaining a variable to track the current end of the chain. For each pair, if the first element is greater than the current chain end, we extend the chain by adding this pair and updating the chain end to this pair's second element. This method ensures that at each step, we're making the most optimal choice to extend the chain without needing to consider previous pairs, thereby maximizing the number of pairs in the chain with the least end values first, leading to the longest possible chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorting the Pairs:** Initially, sort all pairs based on their second element in ascending order. This ensures that as you iterate through the pairs, you are always considering the pair with the next smallest endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initializing Variables:** Start with two variables: one to keep track of the current endpoint of the chain (`currentEnd`) and another to count the number of pairs in the chain (`chainCount`). Initialize `currentEnd` to the lowest possible value (e.g., `Integer.MIN_VALUE`) and `chainCount` to `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterating and Choosing Pairs:** Iterate through the sorted pairs. For each pair, check if its first element is greater than `currentEnd`. If it is, it means this pair can be appended to the current chain. Update `currentEnd` to the second element of this pair and increment `chainCount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** After iterating through all pairs, `chainCount` will hold the maximum number of pairs that can be chained.\n",

    "This Greedy approach is effective because it always chooses the option that seems best at the moment (the pair with the smallest endpoint) and this local optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution in this specific problem context.

    "\n",
    "- Input: \"bbaac\"\n",
    "  - Expected Output: \"bac\"\n",

Then, add the current character to the stack and the 'present' set.\n",
