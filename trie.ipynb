    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a Trie (also known as a Prefix Tree). A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, and is particularly useful for searching for words with a given prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implement the Solution class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution()**: Initializes the object.\n",
    "- **insert(word)**: Inserts word into the trie, making it available for future searches.\n",
    "- **search(word)**: Checks if the word exists in the trie.\n",
    "- **startsWith(word)**: Checks if any word in the trie starts with the given prefix.\n",

    "\n",

    "Trie operations: [\"Trie\", \"insert\", \"search\", \"startsWith\"]\n",
    "Arguments: [[], [\"apple\"], [\"apple\"], [\"app\"]]\n",
    "Expected Output: [-1, -1, 1, 1]\n",
    "Justification: After inserting \"apple\", \"apple\" exists in the Trie. There is also a word that starts with \"app\", which is \"apple\".\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The trie is represented as a tree, where each node contains an array of pointers (or references) to its children and a boolean flag indicating if the current node marks the end of a word. When inserting or searching for a word, we start at the root node and navigate through the tree character by character until we either finish the operation or determine the word doesn't exist in the trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's break down the operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insert:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We begin at the root node.\n",
    "- For every character in the word, check if there's a child node for it.\n",
    "- If the child node doesn't exist, we create it.\n",
    "- Navigate to the child node and repeat the process for the next character.\n",
    "- Once the end of the word is reached, mark the current node as an endpoint of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting at the root, traverse the trie character by character.\n",
    "- For every character in the word, check if there's a child node for it.\n",
    "- If at any point there isn't a child node for the character, the word doesn't exist in the trie.\n",
    "- If we can traverse the entire word and the last node is marked as an endpoint, the word exists in the trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "**StartsWith:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The operation is similar to the search, but we don't need the last node to be an endpoint.\n",
    "- If we can traverse the prefix without any missing nodes, there exists a word in the trie that starts with the given prefix.\n",

    "### Extra Characters in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a string `s` and an array of words `words`, break string `s` into multiple non-overlapping substrings such that each substring should be part of the words. There are some characters left which are not part of any substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of remaining characters in `s`, which are not part of any substring after string break-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "- **Input:** `s = \"amazingracecar\"`, `dictionary = [\"race\", \"car\"]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `7`\n",
    "- **Justification:** The string `s` can be rearranged to form \"racecar\", leaving 'a', 'm', 'a', 'z', 'i', 'n', 'g' as extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "- **Input:** `s = \"bookkeeperreading\"`, `dictionary = [\"keep\", \"read\"]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `9`\n",
    "- **Justification:** The words \"keep\" and \"read\" can be formed from `s`, but 'b', 'o', 'o', 'k', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g' are extra.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "- **Input:** `s = \"thedogbarksatnight\"`, `dictionary = [\"dog\", \"bark\", \"night\"]`\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** `6`\n",
    "- **Justification:** The words \"dog\", \"bark\", and \"night\" can be formed, leaving 't', 'h', 'e', 's', 'a', 't' as extra characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "- 1 <= `str.length` <= 50\n",
    "- 1 <= `dictionary.length` <= 50\n",
    "- 1 <= `dictionary[i].length` <= 50\n",
    "- `dictionary[i]` and `s` consists of only lowercase English letters\n",
    "- `dictionary` contains distinct words\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "The solution approach utilizes a dynamic programming strategy combined with a trie data structure. The dynamic programming aspect allows for efficiently keeping track of the minimum extra characters required at each position in the string `s`. This is achieved by building a bottom-up solution, where we start from the end of the string and work our way towards the beginning, calculating the minimum extra characters required for each substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trie data structure is used to efficiently find and match the words from the dictionary within the string `s`. The combination of these two methods ensures that the solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it avoids redundant computations and efficiently manages the storage of the dictionary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Algorithm\n",
    "1. **Initialize Trie:**\n",
    "   - Construct a trie using the words from the dictionary. Each node in the trie represents a character, and a complete path from the root to a leaf node represents a word.\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Programming Array:**\n",
    "   - Initialize a dynamic programming (DP) array, `dp`, of length `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This array will store the minimum number of extra characters required for the substring starting from each index.\n",
    "3. **DP Calculation:**\n",
    "   - Iterate backwards through the string `s`:\n",
    "     - Set `dp[start]` to `dp[start + 1] + 1` initially. This represents the case where the current character is considered an extra character.\n",
    "     - For each `start` position, iterate through the string to check if a word in the trie can be formed starting from this position.\n",
    "     - If the current substring matches a word in the trie (`node.isEnd` is true), update `dp[start]` to be the minimum of its current value and `dp[end + 1]`, where `end` is the end of the matched word. This step ensures that we consider removing the matched word and count the rest as extra characters.\n",
    "4. **Return Result:**\n",
    "   - The value of `dp[0]` gives the minimum number of extra characters in the entire string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "Let's consider the input `s = \"bookkeeperreading\"`, `dictionary = [\"keep\", \"read\"]`:\n",
    "- **Trie Construction:**\n",
    "  - Build the trie with \"keep\" and \"read\".\n",
    "- **DP Initialization:**\n",
    "  - Initialize `dp` array of length 18 (since \"bookkeeperreading\" has 17 characters).\n",
    "- **DP Calculation:**\n",
    "  - Start from index 16 (last character 'g'):\n",
    "    - For each index, try to form a word from the trie. For example, at index 12, the word \"read\" can be formed.\n",
    "    - Update `dp[12]` to be the minimum of `dp[12]` and `dp[16]` (which is the end of \"read\" + 1).\n",
    "- **Iterate Backwards:**\n",
    "  - Continue this process for each character in `s`. If a character does not form a word in the trie, `dp[start]` remains `dp[start + 1] + 1`.\n",
    "- **Final Result:**\n",
    "  - `dp[0]` will have the minimum extra characters after processing the entire string.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach systematically checks each substring of `s` against the trie, and the dynamic programming array efficiently keeps track of the minimum extra characters required. The use of a trie ensures that each substring check is done in an optimized manner, avoiding unnecessary recomputations."

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a list of distinct strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine a set of product suggestions after each character of the search word is typed. Every time a character is typed, return a list containing up to three product names from the `products` list that have the same prefix as the typed string.\n",

    "If there are more than 3 matching products, return 3 lexicographically smallest products. These product names should be returned in lexicographical (alphabetical) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: Products: [\"apple\", \"apricot\", \"application\"], searchWord: \"app\"\n",
    "Expected Output: [[\"apple\", \"apricot\", \"application\"], [\"apple\", \"apricot\", \"application\"], [\"apple\", \"application\"]]\n",
    "Justification: For the prefix 'a', \"apple\", \"apricot\", and \"application\" match. For the prefix 'ap', \"apple\", \"apricot\", and \"application\" match. For the prefix 'app', \"apple\", and \"application\" match\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, We will use the trie data structure to store the list of products. The trie is built by inserting each product, where each node represents a character. This structure allows us to efficiently find products that share a common prefix.\n",

For each prefix, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node matching the end of the prefix. The DFS is designed to find up to three lexicographically up to 3 smallest words that start with the given prefix. This approach of using a trie combined with DFS for each prefix ensures that we can quickly and effectively generate the required list of product suggestions.\n",

    "**Process Each Prefix of the Search Word:**\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty list to store the final suggestions for each prefix.\n",

    "3. Start from the root of the trie and navigate to the node corresponding to the last character of the current prefix.\n",
    "4. If the node for the current prefix doesn't exist, add an empty list to the suggestions and move to the next prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DFS for Each Prefix:**\n",
    "1. Upon reaching the node corresponding to the current prefix, perform a DFS.\n",
    "2. Initialize an empty buffer to store up to three products.\n",
    "3. Explore all possible paths from the current node. If a path leads to a node marked as a word end, add the corresponding product to the buffer.\n",
    "4. Stop the DFS when you have collected three products or explored all paths.\n",

    "# Design Add and Search Words Data Structure\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a data structure that supports the addition of new words and the ability to check if a string matches any previously added word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `Solution` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Solution()`: Initializes the object.\n",
    "- `void addWord(word)`: Inserts word into the data structure, making it available for future searches.\n",
    "- `bool search(word)`: Checks if there is any word in the data structure that matches word. The method returns true if such a match exists, otherwise returns false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In the search query word, the character '.' can represent any single letter, effectively serving as a wildcard character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "[\"Solution\", \"addWord\", \"addWord\", \"search\", \"search\"]\n",
    "[[], [\"apple\"], [\"banana\"], [\"apple\"], [\".....\"]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output:\n",
    "[-1, -1, -1, 1, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: After adding the words \"apple\" and \"banana\", searching for \"apple\" will return true since \"apple\" is in the data structure. Searching for \".....\" will also return true as both \"apple\" and \"banana\" match the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"Solution\", \"addWord\", \"addWord\", \"search\", \"search\"]\n",
    "[[], [\"cat\"], [\"dog\"], [\"c.t\"], [\"d..g\"]]\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output:\n",
    "[-1, -1, -1, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: \"c.t\" matches \"cat\" and \"d..g\" doesn't matches \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[\"Solution\", \"addWord\", \"search\", \"search\"]\n",
    "[[], [\"hello\"], [\"h.llo\"], [\"h...o\"]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "[-1, -1, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification: \"h.llo\" and \"h...o\" both match \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= word.length <= 25\n",
    "- word in addWord consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- word in search consist of '.' or lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- There will be at most 2 dots in word for search queries.\n",
    "- At most 10^4 calls will be made to addWord and search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of the problem lies in efficiently inserting words and then searching for them, even if the query includes wildcards. To solve this, we utilize the trie (prefix tree) data structure. A trie is a tree-like structure that's useful for storing a dynamic set of strings, especially when the dataset involves large numbers of queries on prefixes of strings. Each node of the trie can represent a character of a word, and the path from the root node to any node represents the word stored up to that point. The key operation for the wildcard is a recursive search, which allows us to explore multiple paths in the trie when we encounter the wildcard character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the word \"apple\" to insert and then search for \".....\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the root node.\n",
    "2. For inserting \"apple\":\n",
    "   - At 'a', move down or create a node if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "   - At 'p', move down or create.\n",
    "   - Do the same for the next 'p', 'l', and 'e'.\n",
    "   - Mark the last node (for 'e') as the end of a word.\n",
    "3. For searching \".....\":\n",
    "   - At the first '.', check all child nodes and continue.\n",
    "   - Repeat for each '.'.\n",
    "   - If any path leads to a node that represents the end of a word, return true.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trie-based approach ensures efficient operations for both inserting and searching for words. In cases without wildcards, the search operation can be performed in linear time relative to the word's length. However, with wildcards, the time complexity might increase, but the trie structure still ensures that we do this efficiently."
