    "\n",
    "Let's discuss one of the fundamental and most used data structures â€“ the Linked List! This chapter aims to unravel the essence of linked lists, their variations, practical applications, and how to implement them across various programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1: What is a Linked List?\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next one in the sequence, forming a chain-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Node Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Value:** The data element stored in the node.\n",
    "- **Next:** A reference to the next node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why Linked Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size:** Easily grows and shrinks in size.\n",
    "- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Quick at the beginning and middle of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of linked lists, there are several types, each serving a unique purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Singly Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Each node points to the next node.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** A music playlist where each song plays after the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Doubly Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Each node has pointers to both the next and the previous nodes.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** A web browser's history, enabling forward and backward navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Circular Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** The last node in the list points back to the first node.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** A multiplayer board game where play returns to the first player after the last.\n",

    "Given the head of a singly linked list, return the head of the reversed list.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: [3, 5, 2]  \n",
    "Expected Output: [2, 5, 3]  \n",

    "Input: [-1, 0, 1]  \n",
    "Expected Output: [1, 0, -1]  \n",

    "- The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].\n",
    "- -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To reverse a singly linked list, begin by setting up two pointers: 'previous' as null and 'current' as the head of the list. Traverse through the list, and during each step, reverse the current node's next pointer to point to the previous node. Then, update 'previous' to be the current node, and 'current' to its original next node. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list. When 'current' becomes null, the reversal is complete, and the 'previous' pointer will be at the new head of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Initialize three pointers: prev to null, current to the head of the list, and next to null.\n",
    "2. **Traversal and Reversal:** Traverse the list. For each node, temporarily store the next node, update the current node's next pointer to point to the prev node, and move the prev and current pointers one step forward.\n",
    "3. **Termination:** When the current pointer reaches the end of the list (null), the prev pointer will be pointing at the new head of the reversed list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm will work because, during the traversal, we are reversing the direction of the pointers between the nodes, which effectively reverses the list. It is efficient and uses only a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Walkthrough:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the input list [3, 5, 2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Initialize prev = null, current = 3.\n",

    "1. **Input:** 1 -> 1 -> 2  \n",

    "    - Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1\n",

    "To determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome, we can utilize a two-pointers approach:\n",

    "1. **Check for Base Cases:** If the head of the doubly linked list is null or if there is only one node (head's next is null), return true.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Palindrome Check Loop:** Traverse the list from both ends towards the middle:\n",
    "    - Compare the values of the nodes pointed by start and end.\n",
    "    - If the values are not equal, return false.\n",
    "    - Move start forward (to the next node) and end backward (to the previous node).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return Result:** If the loop completes without returning false, return true, confirming that the list is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm leverages the nature of a doubly linked list, using both next and previous pointers to compare elements from both ends of the list, reducing time complexity. It is space-efficient as well, as it does not use additional data structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "To swap nodes in pairs in a linked list, start with a temporary node before the list's first node. This helps to easily handle swaps at the beginning. Then, go through the list, looking at two nodes at a time. To switch the position of two nodes, change the links between these nodes. After swapping a pair, move on to the next two nodes. Keep doing this until you reach the end of the list. When you're done, the list will have each pair of nodes swapped, but the order of any remaining single nodes will stay the same. Return the list starting from the node right after your temporary starting node.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Walkthrough:\n",

    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Initialize two pointers, `current` and `previous`. Set `current` to the head of the list and `previous` to null.\n",
    "   - If the list has fewer than two nodes, return the head as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swapping Nodes:**\n",
    "   - For every pair of adjacent nodes, change the `next` pointer of the `previous` node to point to the second node of the pair, and change the `next` pointer of the first node of the pair to point to the node following the second node in the pair. Update the `next` pointer of the second node to point to the first node, effectively swapping them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Updating Pointers:**\n",
    "   - After swapping, move the `current` pointer two steps forward to the next pair of nodes. Update the `previous` pointer to point to the node that was just swapped to its new position.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handling Edge Cases:**\n",
    "   - If the list has an odd number of nodes, the last node will remain in its place since there is no adjacent node to swap with.\n",
